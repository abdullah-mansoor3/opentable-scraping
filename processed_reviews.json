The only issues I noted in my recent visit was the noise level, although it was a busy Friday night.  The bigger issue was the price level, which I noticed since I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been there in quite awhile.  I fear this place will become limited to those of considerable means or on a corporate expense account.  Mere normal seafood lovers need not seek a table given the cost.  I certainly realize this is a post Covid phenomenon in NYC, but disappointed to see it in play here.  A good start would be to list many more under $100 bottles.  The wine service is deluxe, but I ran up a considerable bill even by choosing one of the low cost bottles listed, which, by the way was wonderful. Perhaps I am naively pining for a recent past, but nevertheless must warn any future visitors to get ready for a big time bill, but for a truly delightful meal in a beautiful, yet noisy room. One never knows when one faces $25-30 apps and $40-50 mains whether the house is gouging a bit or merely covering recent supply and labor price increases.  I hope it is the latter for Oceana!",

The lighting was good so we did not have to squint or use a flashlight to read the menu.  The place was busy, but we never felt rushed.  Everyone was very attentive and friendly.  My water glass was never allowed to get empty. The food was excellent.  We shared a crab cake appetizer that came on a delicious tarter sauce.  I had the sea bass wrapped in cabbage in barley soup.  It was also delicious.   The person I was with had the grilled branzino which they enjoyed very much.  We also ordered a side of creamed spinach which was enough for three.

The selection of oysters was fantastic and we highly recommend the west coast choices.  Dinner was filling but not overly heavy which made our after-dinner walk to Rockefeller Center bearable.  Finally, the service was top notch.  Our glasses never sat empty for long and the attentiveness was unmatched.  Thank you, Oceana!",

It was my friends birthday and we went to go see Sondheim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, like ya do! It was a great spot for a lovely intimate celebration. The kind of place were nosy neighbors or your wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spot you at all.  But, I kid. Maybe a little far from the theater district to walk to. But that may be because my friend had a broken foot. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice she was wearing a boot until we were almost there. But, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a bad friend.  All I can say is You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hop it. But, Once you got there,the food was fantastic!! the lobster scampi was probably the best pasta dish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had in my life and the lobster baked potato \u00e2\u0080\u0093 please stop! The wait staff was attentive but not interruptive the ambience was clean, cool and modern. Only thing I had a problem with was that the fork was shaped in such away and the bowl the pasta was served in was shaped in such a way, that the whole fork could fall into the dish get covered in this deliciously creamy lobster sauce which you then had to lick off your fingers etc. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it when it does that. And may be a few more toast points with the tuna tartare.  But why quibble?! It was absolutely delicious!I hope this place sticks around for a long time!",

The wait staff was attentive but not interruptive the ambience was clean, cool and modern. Only thing I had a problem with was that the fork was shaped in such away and the bowl the pasta was served in was shaped in such a way, that the whole fork could fall into the dish get covered in this deliciously creamy lobster sauce which you then had to lick off your fingers etc. I dont like it when it does that. And may be a few more toast points with the tuna tartare.  But why quibble?! It was absolutely delicious!I hope this place sticks around for a long time!",

        "cleaned_review":"Im not sure our Thanksgiving meal was indicative of the restaurant on a usual basis but a $600 meal for 3 adults and 1 child should have had more care applied to the quality of the meat. The turkey appeared to have been left out for a long period of time and was hard to cut and barely palatable.   After the meal I decided to let the manager know via email and his terse reply we served 500 meals and yours was the only complaint motivated this response. Not appropriate.   The staff was wonderful and decor very festive.",

I prefer pasta al dente and vegetables firm, but the \"risotto\" was flat out undercooked and poorly flavored with add-on's rather than cooked-in's. High-quality cod was overpowered by sauce. The dessert seemed like a poor quality pre-packaged thawed item bought in bulk, worsened by throwing some kind of overly sweet preservative and crushed candy on it. The time between courses was much too long. The annex room at the west end of the restaurant where we were seated needs some additional decor to approach the overall 4-star ambiance that the main dining area earns.

After speaking with the manager, we left for the show without dinner! The manager simply said they had unanticipated volume and were running way behind (again, the restaurant was maybe 75% full with no wait for a table on a Friday night, so it is unclear why they were not prepared?).

We sat at the bar, Justin was our bartender, he had wonderful recommendations and helped make our night one that will keep us coming back.   Though our meal may sound simple, it was superb. The ceviche tacos were the perfect balance of fish and accompaniments. The halibut was fresh and light paired with the avocado and delicious flavors that made for a fiesta in our mouths. Now, the sliders... never did I think I could get nuts, dream about a slider. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened. You have to try to believe how   scrumptious these little burgers are. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the burger, not overpowered by cheese (we skipped onions) or the light poppy seed bun.And the dessert, a  mousse crunch... I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten 10 of them (btw I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat dessert, it was only because it was my birthday, but when I go back, I will order dessert again birthday or no birthday).  The entire meal was comfortable and delicious. All the staff couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been friendlier or more accommodating.  Great pre-cursor to the theatre! What a treat!",

I so much appreciate a round table for a 6-person party.  Service was good- I like the waitstaff asked if had a show to get to, and what our timing was.  Not every restaurant thinks to ask.  It';s great to have a choice of a \"pre-theater\" menu, a \"tasting menu\" and the \"regular\" menu.  Value is about average for NYC.",
