"Unfortunately, we found that the food lacked flavor.  The roast chicken was bland as were the lyonnaise potatoes. Ordered a chilled half lobster that was presented on a giant pile of crushed ice for $32. The lobster was removed from the shell and was minuscule. Must have come from a baby lobster. Ridiculous presentation at a ridiculous price.",3 days ago,3,2,3,3,"Unfortunately, we found that the food lacked flavor.  The roast chicken was bland as were the lyonnaise potatoes.

"This is my second time at Oceana Restaurant, though the first trip was quite a long time ago. Reserved table for 2 for pre broadway show dinner.   Overall experience was enjoyable but I expect it better from the this type of establishment. Here is my feedback:  1) Ambiance - open large restaurant with private rooms. Gets noisy. The tables for two are tiny. If you want to share dishes, not enough space.   2) Reservations and Seating - easy via opentable. Though they needed a few min to be ready, was easy to enjoy the bar and they seat you promptly.   3) Food - I really wish that they kept some of the menu choices from past, my personal favourite was coriander and rhubarb root sorbet options. Still passion fruit and mixed fruit were not bad. Best dishes we had were Gnocchi (amazing) and Corn Raviolli. Asparagus Risotto and Soft Shell crab were done well too.  Squash blossoms appetizer is deep fried, not really tasty, simply would not recommend at all. Overall we enjoyed the food.   4) Service - this is our biggest disappointment and reflected on the rating. First I want to say that staff is polite, we were there early for 5pm dinner so dishes came out quickly and at the right temperature. The issue I had is with expectation of service at the table. The staff came over few times to ask if we want anything however it's what they didn't do: brought the bottle of water but besides first time pouring it never followed up on doing so again; never asked how the food was; left empty dishes on our table for a long period of time and didn't move them. We had large table so luckily I was moving the empty dishes to the side. They didn't start the cleanup till we asked to see the desert menu. For us, service should not be overly intrusive but basic things like pouring water, taking plates are a must. Just felt they could have done a bit better.","September 26, 2024",3,4,3,5,"This is my second time at Oceana Restaurant, though the first trip was quite a long time ago.

"Iâve always liked Oceana as a lunch spot (esp. business lunches).  The food remains dependable.  However, Iâm soured after my last 2 lunches reflected plain âol lousy service). Twice Iâve sat staring into space waiting for a menu for 10 minutes.  I mean, this is basic.  Then, while there are a flurry of people moving around and the busâers help the cause by brining quick drinks, the actual servers who take your order and who attend to the cadence of the meal are just lousy.  I honestly wouldnât have had a menu for 20 mins unless I asked, and then, had to harangue the bus help to get a server.  After that, not a soul checks in with you, other than coursing the meal.  Paying the check is an affair where youâre left scanning and scanning and scanning for someone â¦ anyone â¦ to help you.   Not again for lunch.

"Here is a review of the chefs tasting menu and wine pairing at Oceans in New York City:  My wife and I celebrated her birthday with the exceptional chefs tasting menu and exquisite wine pairings at Oceans. From start to finish, it was a night of culinary excellence.  We began with beautifully composed opening bites - tuna tartare and black bass crudo - complemented by crisp, refreshing sparklers. The tuna was paired with a delightful RaventÃ³s i Blanc rosÃ© that offered delicate red fruits and pastry notes. My crudo sang alongside a mineral-driven Cremant de Savoie.  The lobster roe linguine course was a revelation, with the tender, briny pasta impeccably matched by a Sonoma Chardonnay's bright salinity and verve.  For our mains, my Scottish salmon arrived perfectly cooked, beautifully plated with lentils, greens, and mushrooms in a lush cream sauce. A Burgundian Pinot Noir provided an aromatic counterpunch of spices and red fruits. My wife's seared scallops were sweet and succulent over an English pea puree, with a Loire Valley Chinon offering vibrant red fruit to accent the gnocchi and brown butter.  Desserts did not disappoint - a decadent chocolate tart and sublime pistachio semifreddo complemented by the caramelized notes of an aged tawny port. As a bonus birthday treat, the kitchen sent out a complimentary celebratory cake paired with a luscious Moscato d'Asti.  The attentive and knowledgeable service,combined with the artful dishes and pitch-perfect wine pairings, made this an evening to remember at Oceans. An indulgent yet balanced tour de force of flavor from an extraordinary kitchen and cellar.","April 29, 2024",5,5,5,5,"Here is a review of the chefs tasting menu and wine pairing at Oceans in New York City:  My wife and I celebrated her birthday with the exceptional chefs tasting menu and exquisite wine pairings at Oceans.

"We have been to Oceana many times but have not been in at least 6 months. The host was very welcoming and brought us to our table. We asked for a booth but it was not available for another half hour so we sat at a table for two. We felt a bit rushed being asked if we wanted to order a drink before we were even settled into our seats. We ordered two martinis. The martinis were $27 each which is almost twice most restaurants in NYC. The focaccia bread was delicious but the oil for the bread was served in a deep portion cup which made it awkward to dip and impossible to add salt and pepper. A shallow dish would have been much better or even butter. We ordered the grilled octopus to share which was much like we remembered it. For our main dish we ordered the Monkfish Wellington for two. When it was brought to the table to serve it clearly was the first time for the server. The Wellington fell apart and the meal was cold when we finally ate it. We had a bottle of wine with dinner which several people served, two of them dribbled as much on the glass and table as in the glass. It was an expensive meal that didn't feel like a special night out like past experiences. The lights were bright and the usual ambience was just not there. I hope it was just an off night because it used to be one of our favorite places.","March 22, 2024",4,4,3,2,"We have been to Oceana many times but have not been in at least 6 months.

"This is the second time I have had dinner at Oceana and greatly enjoyed both meals.  My friend and I were both celebrating our birthdays, so I had asked for an especially nice table.  We were seated at one of the most attractive tables in the restaurant, which doesn't always happen when the diners are two older women.  We both had the same things:  a crab cake starter and a branzino main.  Both dishes were generous portions that were beautifully prepared.  For dessert my friend had a beautifully presented pistachio semi fredo and I had a tasty sticky toffee pudding.  We didn't need to have ordered desert because we were treated to a marvelous chocolate mousse cake with two candles.

"Stopped by Oceana for a quick solo lunch and it was fantastic. Impeccable service, beautiful wine list, and wonderful menu options. The house Sommelier was very knowledgeable and all the staff were very friendly and professional. I settled on the Monopole Heidseick Brut half bottle of Champagne which was a pleasant surprise on the wine list. Paired that with a few Little Neck Clams to start, and then the Lobster Scampi Pasta. It was a perfect meal that has me craving for more. Canât wait to come back soon.  Cheers ð¥","January 19, 2024",5,5,5,5,"Stopped by Oceana for a quick solo lunch and it was fantastic.

"It is a very well run restaurant from check in to server. I ordered the special lunch, which included an appetizer (it was delicious), entrÃ©e and a dessert for a very reasonable $35.  I chose the calamari as my entrÃ©e,  and the plate consisted of four or five nicely arranged pieces of it.  I had expected the usual fried and breaded calamari, and the taste of this very un-breaded calamari was not to my liking.  My server without any hesitation offered to replace it with any other entrÃ©e on the special lunch menu. I ordered the chicken dish, which was was delicious. I would highly recommend it and Oceana.","January 18, 2024",5,5,5,5,"It is a very well run restaurant from check in to server.

"We had not been back to Oceana since the Pandemic. The restaurant had been completely renovated, and we found a ""warmer"" atmosphere. There is a full lunch menu with their usual menu and they offer a three-course special, with choices of an appetizer, main, and dessert for $37.50. It was interesting to find oysters as a choice since that is one of their specialties. As always, the food was delicious, and portions were not down-sized for lunch. My wife and I both chose that option and her main was Branzino and mine was Monkfish. I knew that beverages would be at an additional cost. But $4 for an iced tea and $7 for coffee seems a bit much, even for NYC. Definitely what we call a ""price performer"" in the retail world.","January 10, 2024",5,5,5,5,"We had not been back to Oceana since the Pandemic.

"This place has gone WAY downhill in the past 3 years. It used to be one of the nicer restaurants in the Rockefeller area, rivaling Del Friscos. But last night the service was insanely slow and the food sub-par, especially for the insane prices. It took 45 minutes for anyone to take our order and that's after we had asked twice. Our fish dishes were all very bland and the fish wasn't cooked well. Almost like what you'd get at a wedding hall.

I said our reservation was for 3pm how can that be and that Oceana should not take reservations at 3pm if that is the case.

But then out of no where entire kitchen and wait staff started eating there dinner in the dinning room, albeit off to the side but still in the dinning room with other patrons. Very bizarre.

"I love this restaurant, and have for years, and my recent visit gave me little reason to change my view.  The only issues I noted in my recent visit was the noise level, although it was a busy Friday night.  The bigger issue was the price level, which I noticed since I hadnât been there in quite awhile.  I fear this place will become limited to those of considerable means or on a corporate expense account.  Mere normal seafood lovers need not seek a table given the cost.  I certainly realize this is a post Covid phenomenon in NYC, but disappointed to see it in play here.  A good start would be to list many more under $100 bottles.  The wine service is deluxe, but I ran up a considerable bill even by choosing one of the low cost bottles listed, which, by the way was wonderful. Perhaps I am naively pining for a recent past, but nevertheless must warn any future visitors to get ready for a big time bill, but for a truly delightful meal in a beautiful, yet noisy room. One never knows when one faces $25-30 apps and $40-50 mains whether the house is gouging a bit or merely covering recent supply and labor price increases.  I hope it is the latter for Oceana!","December 9, 2023",4,5,5,4,"I love this restaurant, and have for years, and my recent visit gave me little reason to change my view.

The ambiance is chic and classy. Lovely decor which suggests that it would be a way more expensive experience than it is. The prix fixe pre-theater menu is a great value and offers three lovely courses. The swordfish ceviche was deliciously tangy. The mahi-mahi was perfectly cooked and complemented. The mixed fruit sorbet was a lovely cleansing end to the meal. They have a great wine and beer list. Service was attentive without being overbearing. Will definitely return.,"November 11, 2023",5,5,5,5,The ambiance is chic and classy. Lovely decor which suggests that it would be a way more expensive experience than it is.

"Oceana is a great fine dining experience with a gallant atmosphere and balanced choice of flavors between the many options they have for food and drinks.   Out of the appetizers my group tried, the Tuna Tartar was a freshing start to the meal to prep you stomach for the main course and my favorite. For main course, the swordfish was exquisite and while it was not the main entree I chosed, it is one I easily go back for. As for desert, the lemon cheese cake was the cherry on top for my meal is it add the perfect blend of sour and sweet to wrap everything up.  Lastly for drinks, a friend had asked the bartenders for their recommendations and they did not disappoint. The Sun Dial and Pep in your Step were both fantastic entries to compliment your meals and acted like a string to tie all the flavors together.  Oceana was a fantastic experience and cannot wait to look to dining there again.","September 16, 2023",5,4,5,5,"Oceana is a great fine dining experience with a gallant atmosphere and balanced choice of flavors between the many options they have for food and drinks.

"Very overpriced for the quality of food and service. Didn't have one of the courses that we chose as part of the taster menu...at $95. Caesar salad was poor, had better in the bar down the road. Taster menu is just pick your own 4 courses which were all served really quickly with no break between courses. Had the wine flight to go with the taster menus but felt they were just random wines that didn't match the food. Fish dish was dry. Waiter took drinks away before they were finished.

"Oceana is a great lunch spot and I'll definitely be back.  The food is great. My firm gives us free money to get lunch at restaurants downtown, so I've tried all of the decent restaurants in the area. Oceana was my favorite spot (excluding all the crazy $120+ per-person meals).  The food is memorable. There are a hundred midtown steakhouses that are all good but completely forgettable. Steak tastes the same everywhere; it's just a slab of meat. Oceana is different. It serves food with personality.  The service was excellent. One member in our party used a wheelchair and I was concerned we might get seated at a table too tall or cramped for them to comfortably sit at. I requested accommodations in the reservation and the staff were very prepared: (1) they flagged us down as soon as we entered, (2) they had already mapped out a route for us to get to the table, (3) they had cleared the path to get there ahead of time, and (4) our table fit everyone perfectly.

"I had a disappointing experience at Oceana. Let me start by saying our group, comprised of three 20 year-olds, were well-behaved and respectful. However, it was evident our server was unhappy when we did not opt for the wine pairing or cocktails. One person in our group ordered the mussels, and it was clear to all of us, who have dined at nice restaurants before, something was off. The mussels tasted rancid and had a strong zoo-like odor; they were far from fresh. We kindly asked for a replacement dish, which our waiter reluctantly agreed to, but not without giving us disapproving and disgusted looks from the bar. From that point on, he never bothered to refill our water glasses, leaving them empty for the rest of the meal. Besides the mussels, the food was flavorful, but dishes were small. As a young traveler, I would suggest younger groups steer clear of this restaurant as it seems they do not believe young people can appreciate good food too.","July 15, 2023",2,2,2,5,"I had a disappointing experience at Oceana.

"Decor is very nice.  Hostesses were warm and detail oriented, we were seated promptly in a requested table type.  Wine list is good, we had an excellent bottle.  The bussing staff and the expediters delivering food were very efficient.  Management and Sommelier were attentive to the dining room.  Our waiter was just OK.  Had to ask another staff member to get him twice.  I was overall underwhelmed with the food given reputation.  I had the crab cake, it was a very good portion and it had plenty of crabmeat but the sauce it was set upon was bland and unimaginative.  Did it actually have mustard in it?  Please just take the current cabbage wrapped halibut preparation off the menu, and do something else with the halibut.  Fish itself portion and temperature were fine, but plain Jane barley underneath with a super salty and otherwise tasteless broth poured on top of the fish - there were some shiitakeâs floated in the broth but you did not taste mushrooms.  Very disappointed in the preparation.  Then I had the tiramisu.  Plated in a pretty way, not overly sweet but thatâs all I can say about it.  No espresso or cocoa flavor, the base layer of sponge cake was so thin as to almost be invisible.  In the category of not worth the calories.  I tasted the chocolate mouse cake, also nothing special. Does anyone in the kitchen taste things before plates leave the kitchen?    Brussel sprouts and fries were both good.

"This review is a little late but absolutely necessary. I went to Oceana with by girlfriend for our two year anniversary and we where absolutely blown away! The food was phenomenal. Each course was well balanced, and the dishes where clearly well thought out. Although the food was superb it also managed to not be to stuffy or overly pretentious, which is a nice switch up from most of the restaurants in the area which over-promise and under-deliver. The pastry chef even sent us a dessert cake with the words ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate on the plate. Next was the service, which was equally attentative and enthusiastic. Our water glasses where never empty, our suggested cocktails where exactly what we where looking for, and at no point did we feel overwhelmed OR neglected. As for the dining room... a beautiful place to eat without question. And, the chefs counter was especially fun for us because we got to watch all the magic happen in the kitchen while we ate. We even got to ask the chef what he recommends, which is a privilege not widely available in the Manhattan dining scene. The teams in both the front and the back of the house really made our anniversary as special as they could. 10/10 recommend.","March 18, 2023",5,5,5,5,"This review is a little late but absolutely necessary.

"I had high hopes for this place.  Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  The ambiance and plating was beautiful, however all the food was very flat flavors.  We had the truffle ricotta ravioli and the sea bass with crab ciopinno.  The ravioli had Visible truffles, but ZERO truffle flavor.  The whole dish didnât have much flavor at all.  The sea bass was good but was a very tiny piece.  The mussels and clams were ok but nothing special.  At the end of the day it was a $200 bill and still left not full.  We ended up walking around and stopped in at a Cuban restaurant which blew Oceana away with the drinks.  I really wanted to like Oceana but will definitely not be back.","January 22, 2023",2,2,4,5,"I had high hopes for this place.  Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.

"Had not been here in quite some time and decided to celebrate our 55th here.  We were led to an excellent table by a welcoming staff.  After that, our waiter, Isaiah, just seemed to go through the motions being pleasant when he came to the table but the intervals were quite long especially at the beginning in starting things off properly. Aside from the lack of attention from such a fine establishment, everything else was superb.  Our pre-fixe theater menu was excellent with great choices, presentation, fine taste and more than ample portions supplemented by extra oysters and glasses of prosecco.

I don't usually go for the wine pairing, but with this and all the dishes being so spectacular and bursting with flavor I HIGHLY recommend getting the paring which comes with every dish. Very knowledgeable and excellent sommelier. He truly brought out the flavor of the wine and the dish. I would go there again 1000%. There is a coat check as well so you are not cluttered at your table. Great location conveniently right outside of Times Square so it was great for our NYC Christmas trip. They also have a semi-private table with sliding privacy doors if desired for larger parties that is in the middle of the restaurant which is nice not to be secluded. Also there is a bar or bar tables if you prefer that to the traditional dining area. DEFINITELY make this restaurant part of your NYC trip. 5 star review all around for everything.

It was a little noisy, but the tables are relatively far apart so we could still hear each other comfortably.  The lighting was good so we did not have to squint or use a flashlight to read the menu.  The place was busy, but we never felt rushed.  Everyone was very attentive and friendly.  My water glass was never allowed to get empty. The food was excellent.  We shared a crab cake appetizer that came on a delicious tarter sauce.  I had the sea bass wrapped in cabbage in barley soup.  It was also delicious.   The person I was with had the grilled branzino which they enjoyed very much.  We also ordered a side of creamed spinach which was enough for three.

Our order was taken promptly, our glasses of wine and appetizer salads brought reasonably promptly. Then we waited for almost an hour for our salmon and codfish entrees.

"Celebrating my 60th bday. We were seated alllll the way in the back, next to the restroom. The blame may be on my husband, as he could not recall if he advisedâ¦ it did, however, impact the experience.  Started with the grilled octopus. While slightly overcooked, it was still very tastyâ¦ especially with the humus dip that accompanies it.  I ordered the lobster scampi and my husband had the swordfish and the Brussel sprouts. The entree portions were extremely small for the price.  A very small piece of fish; lots of pasta, and very little lobster, and soggy Brussels.  Also, the dishes were delivered warmâ¦ not piping hot as they should have been. Lastly, I asked the server if I could have a little humus dip for my scampi (as sheâd advised that there was no sauce)â¦ she advised that she would make it happen. She provided a full plate of the humus???  Later, when the bill came, sheâd included a charge for the plate of humus, despite the fact that she never advised that there would be a charge.  To be honest, I most likely would have still ordered the humus (it is truly delicious, and the dry pasta needed plenty of help), I strongly believe in transparency and providing info so customers can make informed decisions.  I usually LOVE my restaurant experiences in NYCâ¦ this time, many of my visits were a bust! Overall, we were not impressedâ¦ especially given the cost. I believe there are better dining options for this price point.","November 22, 2022",3,3,4,2,"Celebrating my 60th bday. We were seated alllll the way in the back, next to the restroom.

"We had one regular menu, one pre-theater prix fixe. Worked out to just the right amount of food for the two of us. The oysters on the prix fixe (Davenports, from Massachusetts) were new to us, and briny just as we like our oysters. There was a lovely herbed vinaigrette with them, as well as a slightly too vinegary mignonette and a cocktail sauce. Octopus app and mahi mahi and halibut mains were perfectly cooked. Octopus was tender, not mushy, not tough, and a very good size portion. Both fish were juicy. Accompaniments om all plates enhanced the flavors. An extra side order of mushrooms was copious and well seasoned. The prix fixe dessert we chose, a deconstructed Creamsicle, was lovely. BTG wines were well advised by the sommelier.

"The food was generally good, especially my companionâs salmon dish, and our desserts. However, in an all-white  (!) seafood dish of roasted cod,  the element of underdone leeks was off-putting. The cross-cut leeks were tough and hard to chew.  Not at all appetizing.   Oceanaâs space is cavernous and hard-surfaced. Not too many diners were present, so the sound level was ok. A full house would have impeded conversation, we think.   Oceanaâs price range leads you to think all will be perfect.  There are rough edges, though.","September 16, 2022",3,4,5,3,"The food was generally good, especially my companions salmon dish, and our desserts.

"Beautiful restaurant, great food but I would not recommend dining before the theater. The hostess and server knew we had theater tickets. We arrived at 5:15 and had great service but at 6:15 I had to ask for our entrees. We only had 15 minutes to quickly eat our beautifully prepared, delicious and expensive dinners. I ordered the pre-theater special. The server brought my sorbet and the check and we had to run to the theater. It was very stressful. The server was lovely and we were left wondering what was the breakdown.

When I asked about the possibility of sitting at the high table overlooking the kitchen, I was told that I need to have made a reservation on line prior to a visit. I then asked if it was reserved this day. The hostess conferred with management and she then said, âfollow meâ then seated us at the one and only three seat table with a fabulous view of the busy kitchen.  Colossal shrimp, many oyster options, Cesar salads, tile fish lunch specials, Pimmâs sour, wine, they treated us to an extra dessert, espresso and a cafe au lait. We were treated like special guests.It was a great experience.","July 13, 2022",5,5,5,5,"Lunch extravaganza at Oceana Restaurant in NYC before the show.

"Okay first of all, I have never left a ""perfect score"" review.  But Oceana deserves it. The combination of ambience, professional service, through Victor and Phillip-pe (how it's pronounced) including a fantastic Sommelier service through Matthew was probably the most perfect meal I have ever had at a New York restaurant (and I am in the winter of my life).

"I met my clients at Oceana for a pre-theater dinner for 3. We were seated near the kitchen and restrooms in a busy traffic area of the restaurant. Our server was young and not well-versed on the food or drink menus. When asking to substitute the blue cheese sauce on the filet for a bÃ©arnaise, they looked bewildered and told us they would confirm with the kitchen. We didnât see her again for the rest of our meal, and the steak arrived without any sauce or garnish at all. Another guest and I chose the theater-specific menu, which offered three courses for $55 and a wine pairing for each course for a total of $95. While the sommelier stopped by our table before our server arrived, we were not told what the wines were. As each course arrived, we asked which wine we were drinking, and they simply replied ârose,â âPinot noir,â and âmoscato.â When pressed for a little more information like where it was from, the person delivering the glass simply shrugged. Granted, this is a Times Square restaurant, however, at the premium marketing and posh vibe the restaurant presents, we were disappointed. When the check arrived, our original server reappeared and thanked us for coming. Truly a bizarre experience and a real let-down.","June 17, 2022",2,3,1,4,"I met my clients at Oceana for a pre-theater dinner for 3.

"We ate here a few years ago. The food was just OK then and the ambiance quite nice.  Given it's easy access to the theater to which we were headed we decided to try again.  The food was authentically awful.  The overpriced salads were wilted greens, the bread seemed to have been at least a week old, the 2 jumbo shrimp were tasteless and chewy.  The risotto was OK albeit skimpy.  The lobster scampi fettuccine was disgusting.  While some might like orange fettuccine, I found it off-putting. Rather than al dente, I needed a knife. Shouldn't have bothered since the so-called lobster scampi was bits and pieces which were too chewy to eat easily.  The taste of the entire entree was nauseating. Probably helps explain why Oceana lost its one Michelin star.  The charming ambiance has been replaced by painful noise even though the restaurant wasn't full. If our waiter ever spoke to us, we never heard him. We chose to skip dessert just to escape the brutality of the noise. While we will never return for a third try, our recommendation is to not give it a first try.","May 28, 2022",1,1,2,1,"We ate here a few years ago.

Probably helps explain why Oceana lost its one Michelin star.  The charming ambiance has been replaced by painful noise even though the restaurant wasn't full. If our waiter ever spoke to us, we never heard him. We chose to skip dessert just to escape the brutality of the noise. While we will never return for a third try, our recommendation is to not give it a first try."

"Have eaten at Oceana many times, usually on every trip to NYC. But don't think will go back there again. Remodel has made it way to loud, hard to talk to the people at the table. Also, had a really bad experience with the food this time. We lived in Maryland over 40 years before retiring to Colorado, so when I saw ""lump crab cake"" on the menu decided to try it. I was assured it was the ""real thing"" by server. Well, suffice it to say that it was not. It was flat, thin and looked like a McDonald's hamburger, not a half-baseball size mound that I expected. But the real killer was that it did not not have one piece of ""lump"" crabmeat, it was all shredded crabmeat, and it did not taste very good either. When I told the server that this was not a lump crab cake she said she would take it back and show the chef. When she came back she said the chef said it WAS lump crab cake. Say What? I was in the hotel and restaurant business and I knew it was not. I asked to speak to the manager and he backed up the chef, although he did say I could order something else instead and would not be charged for the ""lump"" crab cake, which I did.  I did not feel that a restaurant like Oceana should have behaved like this. We have a lot of other favorites in New York and will be going to them next time.","May 25, 2022",1,3,4,2,"Have eaten at Oceana many times, usually on every trip to NYC.

"Food was excellent.  We requested to order our main courses when our appetizers arrived as were in no hurry.  The waiter indicated the restaurant policy is to order all food at once...except the table behind us asked for the same thing (quite loudly).

It was frustratingly obvious they were trying to push us out.  Additionally, half way through our meal, our waiter (I believe was the head waiter) decided we were not worth his time and stopped being our waiter.

"We arrived on time for our reservation but it took them 20 or so minutes to seat us.  That wasnât so bad, but then we sat at our table for at least another 20 minutes before anyone came to take drink orders and give us menus.  Our server was apologetic and he was a nice guy, but the service remained slow throughout the night.  The portions were on the small side, and they were not inexpensive.  However, the food was delicious and creatively presented.  We enjoyed stone crabs, which are a treat to find in New York as we have only had them when we travel to Florida during the short stone crab season.  We also had the bouillabaisse, which was flavorful and presented in a modern way with classic flavor, as well as the loup de mer en croute, which was crispy and light with delicate sauce.  The dessert, a pistachio and chocolate creation, was the highlight of the meal.

Our server was apologetic and he was a nice guy, but the service remained slow throughout the night.  The portions were on the small side, and they were not inexpensive.  However, the food was delicious and creatively presented.  We enjoyed stone crabs, which are a treat to find in New York as we have only had them when we travel to Florida during the short stone crab season.  We also had the bouillabaisse, which was flavorful and presented in a modern way with classic flavor, as well as the loup de mer en croute, which was crispy and light with delicate sauce.  The dessert, a pistachio and chocolate creation, was the highlight of the meal.

This is a beautiful restaurant and we were there early so it wasnât crowded at all and was quiet . The service was fine but the food was disappointing .

"This was a tough one to rate because there was a lot to like about it. But what ultimately pushed me to the three star side over the four star side was the service, which is the one thing that is the difference between our coming back again or not. We eat out a lot, and to me service is as important as the taste.  Here's the thing ... If the restaurant was busy, it might be understandable. If it had been New Year's Eve at 10 p.m. (or even at 8 p.m.), it might be understandable. But it was 6:30. Not even half the restaurant was full; maybe a quarter. A good number of servers and back waiters were literally just standing around.  That our server walked by us a countless number of times without ever asking us for a drink order; or that it took over an hour for him to actually take our food order (after having to flag him down originally to take our oyster order), is just inexcusable.  Speaking of oysters, we ordered more than a dozen, two of each. I was dumbfounded that the person who brought the oysters out didn't take a moment to tell us which were which; and I was even more dumbfounded when we flagged our waiter over to ask him and he told us that he would have no idea and we should have asked the guy who brought them out. Wait, what?  Even more annoyed that they were served with most not being released and having shell fragments.  Our waiter was MIA most of the night. Well, he did stand a lot in the back area and walked by us. But for us he was MIA. The place was less than half full and he was not in the weeds. Inexcusable again.  If the service isn't up to par and causes more annoyance than enjoyment, it's nearly impossible to enjoy the food or experience. Sadly this is why after two NYE's there, we will not be going back this year.

"An enjoyable evening, with good quality food albeit slight skimpy portions. The wine steward was informative and we appreciated not being rushed on a Friday night in the holiday season.

"We needed to go out to dinner after a show on Broadway and Oceana popped up. Iâm so glad it did! It was my friends birthday and we went to go see Sondheimâs company, like ya do! It was a great spot for a lovely intimate celebration. The kind of place were nosy neighbors or your wifeâs friends wouldnât spot you at all.  But, I kid. Maybe a little far from the theater district to walk to. But that may be because my friend had a broken foot. I didnât even notice she was wearing a boot until we were almost there. But, Iâm a bad friend.  All I can say is You wouldnât want to hop it. But, Once you got there,the food was fantastic!! the lobster scampi was probably the best pasta dish Iâve ever had in my life and the lobster baked potato â please stop! The wait staff was attentive but not interruptive the ambience was clean, cool and modern. Only thing I had a problem with was that the fork was shaped in such away and the bowl the pasta was served in was shaped in such a way, that the whole fork could fall into the dish get covered in this deliciously creamy lobster sauce which you then had to lick off your fingers etc. I donât like it when it does that. And may be a few more toast points with the tuna tartare.  But why quibble?! It was absolutely delicious!I hope this place sticks around for a long time!","December 14, 2021",5,5,5,5,"We needed to go out to dinner after a show on Broadway and Oceana popped up.

Even though dining here was my idea, even though I picked up the tab, the guy wouldn't look at me or make eye contact, which he did with the other three WHITE people at my table.

We ordered the chef tasting menu with wine pairing. The presentation was off (food arrived before the sommelier had shown up to introduce himself and tell us about our wine options/recommendations. Mind you we waited a long time for the first course to arrive; generally the sommelier was as informative/engaging as a turnip. He was literally just going through the motions with an attitude that conveyed the message that he wished he was elsewhere). The rest of the courses were  late (wait staff did apologize for the delay at some point midway through the 2d course). Taste wise and presentation wise I and my 3 guests rate the food as a 1 out 5.

"Excellent food but very slow service. We went for a pre-theater dinner, with 5:30 reservations. While we were able to leave as  planned at 7:30, there wasnât time for dessert.

They were not happy.  Nor were we , waiting at at least 45 minutes for our main courses. The kitchen obviously canât handle a full pre-theatre crowd.

"Visiting from out of town and we thought a nice Thanksgiving dinner in the city would be nice. Oceana advertised traditional Thanksgiving fare so we thought we would give it a try. The appetizers we got, celery chowder and the tuna tartare, were ok, but the portions were very small. The turkey platter was not good. It seemed as though it was processed turkey and it was very dry and with not much flavor. The gravy, which was very liquidy and poured all over the plate, was not good and ruined most of the food on it. The sweet potato purÃ©e was good as were the mashed potatoes. One person in our party got the baked cod and that was also good. The desserts were nothing special and they had run out of the pumpkin cheesecake. We had also asked for extra bread and they never brought it. The bill for three people was over $500 for a meal that probably was worth about $150 tops. Very disappointed with the quality and selection of the food, but I guess going to a seafood restaurant for a turkey dinner was probably not the best choice.","November 26, 2021",3,3,4,5,"Visiting from out of town and we thought a nice Thanksgiving dinner in the city would be nice.

"For a restaurant this big to serve so many people so well on Thanksgiving Day, we felt was impressive and noteworthy on this, our first experience dining at Oceana.  After some delay in being seated at the beginning, we shortly realized that wait was worth it.  Once we had ordered and our food was served, we noted that there was excellent attention to detail in the preparation and presentation  of the food, which lloed attractive as well as deliciously flavorful.  One might have expected that by 7pm on a day when Thanksgiving dinner was being served from noontime until 8:30, that late in the day, some menu items would have run out.  But that was not the case at Oceana last evening.  We will certainly be back, since we love fish and live in midtown Manhattan and  often attend concerts of classical music nearby.  Kudos to Oceana for good food and good service.

Iâm not sure our Thanksgiving meal was indicative of the restaurant on a usual basis but a $600 meal for 3 adults and 1 child should have had more care applied to the quality of the meat. The turkey appeared to have been left out for a long period of time and was hard to cut and barely palatable.

"In terms of value, Oceana flops. The same meal for $50 in Manhattan would have been disappointing, but not unexpected. At $110, it should have been better. I prefer pasta al dente and vegetables firm, but the ""risotto"" was flat out undercooked and poorly flavored with add-on's rather than cooked-in's. High-quality cod was overpowered by sauce. The dessert seemed like a poor quality pre-packaged thawed item bought in bulk, worsened by throwing some kind of overly sweet preservative and crushed candy on it. The time between courses was much too long. The annex room at the west end of the restaurant where we were seated needs some additional decor to approach the overall 4-star ambiance that the main dining area earns.

"Had a reservation and seated quickly upon arrival. Beautiful place. Waited several minutes for water and bread. Ordered from the Theatre menu trio and selected fried calamari, grilled swordfish and the orange creamsicle parfait. The calamari arrived hot,  with a nice crunchy coating but the calamari itself was slightly rubbery and had no flavor whatsoever. The grilled swordfish was however, delicious and very flavorful as were the purÃ©ed potatoes and broccoli rabe that accompanied it. The temperature of the swordfish and sides was lukewarm and most likely sat in the window before arriving to the table. Dessert was small but tasty and the orange creamsicle flavor was reminiscent of childhood. Service was below average and my waiter never asked me if my food tasted good and he was gone for long periods of time. It is true he had other tables, several that came and left before me but had arrived after me. I had to ask for my check along with requesting my dessert as it was getting close to the time of my Broadway show. Overall great food and below average service. Just based on service alone, I would not return.","November 20, 2021",3,4,2,3,"Had a reservation and seated quickly upon arrival. Beautiful place. Waited several minutes for water and bread.

Have eaten here a few times before. Food is great. Scene is great. The waiter however tried to charge me for a more expensive wine than the bottle we actually had. Fortunately I happened to catch it.

"Oceana was close to our hotel and had great reviews so we decided to try it as our last dinner on a Thursday evening before leaving NYC after our 3 day trip. We changed our reservation to an earlier time due to finishing up at The Met and they were more than accommodating. Everything from the service, drinks, menu offerings and food was spot-on. Staff was extremely attentive and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. We skipped appetizers and ordered the Halibut and a combo crab/lobster scampi that might have been a special. My sister said that was the best halibut sheâs ever had and my seafood pasta was decadent. The lobster baked potato was a perfect side to round it out. Loved the calming design atmosphere.

"I made my reservation for dinner (to be directly before a Broadway show) for our 6 year anniversary almost 2 1/2 months before our date. The first thing out of the hostesses mouth was that they'd changed their dinner hours since our reservation. Not sure how that's my problem. Luckily they made an exception and allowed us to eat dinner.  Dinner was sub par and honestly most of the food I cook at home is better.  The Halibut was over cooked and under seasoned. The dish needed more sauce to make it palpable. The Lobster in the noodles dish was also VERY over cooked and needed more to balance out the amount if pasta.  If we hadn't gotten desert I would have likely rated this establishment a 2.  However, their deserts were absolutely fantastic and I would return here JUST for the desert. 10 out of 10, perfection!  If you're going somewhere for a good meal I'd go somewhere else. The wait staff was friendly enough but I think because we were 'out of time' they forgot about us a few times.  They wanted money more than anything, charging $9 for a bottle of water.

"Arrived for a 9pm reservation on a Saturday.  The restaurant was relatively empty so it was a nice atmosphere and quiet enough to enjoy birthday date night. We started with west coast oysters which were delicious. Highly recommended.    I ordered the lobster pasta and my boyfriend order the hammer steak, medium rare.  The. main course took an oddly long time to come out, so much that we had to ask a busboy where our dinner was.  The reason we asked a busboy, was also because our server never came to check on our table after the empty app dished were picked up.  Once dinner finally arrived, the hammer steak was ice cold and was sent back (with another busboy) because the server, again, never visited the table to check on us, in fact, we didn't see him again until we asked for the check at the end of the meal.  When my boyfriend's (refired) steak arrived a second time, I had already finished my dinner, and his medium rare steak was now medium to medium well; which he begrudgingly ate.  Additionally, since the entire service interaction was with the food runner/busser no one offered us a refill of my cocktail which sat in an empty glass in front of me.  When the (I'm assuming he was) manager brought out the retired food, he quickly walked away before I could get a drink order.    Lastly there was no offering of anything for the inconvenience.  My boyfriend and I have both waited tables before.  I understand that the server and front of the house personnel can't possibly be responsible for the actions and mistakes of the witch; however it was the front lines personnel's response (or lack of) in customer service that makes me NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.","August 1, 2021",2,3,1,4,"Arrived for a 9pm reservation on a Saturday.

"Past visits to Oceana have been very enjoyable.  They had an excellent  chef (Bill Telepan), an interesting menu, and a more peaceful ambiance.  The new iteration is very disappointing.  The food was mediocre at best and the new decor seems designed to increase the noise level.  When we arrived, the place was extremely noisy.  The service was less than attentive, which was understandable at first because the restaurant was crowded when we arrived, but service did not improve when the place emptied out.  The menu is limited, so there is less excuse for the poor food quality and execution than there would be in a place that offered more options.

Starting off with a Caesar salad made the way seafood lovers (or any true fan of anchovies) would expect, the entree selections of the salmon and branzino were plated with flair, and the flavors matched the presentation.

"Large restaurant with only a few customers the night we were there. Nevertheless, the service was very slow. I do not believe this was the fault of the wait staff, but rather the kitchen. The food was very good. we liked the seared octopus, Caesar salad, and Smoked Bay Scallop Tagliatelle. The Mushroom Carbonara was good but not special.","April 12, 2021",3,4,2,2,"Large restaurant with only a few customers the night we were there. Nevertheless, the service was very slow.

"Number 1 and most importantly, the food and service was amazing. From the wine, apps, entrees and desert... it was so delicious and rich tasting. The staff was so friendly and respectful, I couldnât have asked for better service. Given that itâs COVID mid-November in NYC, I really didnât want to eat outside, however, also a little hesitant to sit inside. But our reservations were at 6 and I quickly had zero hesitation when I saw the restaurant was empty when we got there. And as more people came the staff did a great job spacing everyone out. Oceana has a fairly large space, especially for NYC, and I felt completely safe eating inside. Itâs probably âless safeâ going to the grocery store than eating inside at a place like Oceana.

"First, the good news: Oceana has terrific oysters and a pasta dish called Squid Ink Paccheri that is just delicious.  I truly wish it had been our whole meal.  Now the bad news: Our entrees weren't up to the level of quality at this expensive $$$$ price point.  The $38 Scottish Salmon wasn't bad but was a little on the fishy side, which if it was really fresh shouldn't have been. The surrounding watercress was nice and fresh, but what was supposed to have been champagne pears and blood orange was an unpleasant, oddly textured, squishy mess.  The mouth feel of this turned me off the whole entree.  The $45 Seared Halibut was done to a turn and would have been a lovely meal if it hadn't been for the accompanying inedible spinach and wild mushrooms which both were so salty, it made my mouth burn for the next 2 hours.  The $20 Shrimp Fried Rice, an odd side dish on this menu for sure, was also overly salty and made with wild rice which was in parts under cooked, accompanied by unpleasantly iodiney shrimp; another fail.  While the service was good, the waitstaff was a little on the intrusive side.  Also, it's nice to know they clean their restrooms with Clorox, but alas, I returned with it all over the bottom of my shoes and while I was sitting at the table the air was perfumed with bleach.  Not the best experience over all and certainly not at these prices.","February 26, 2020",3,3,4,4,"First, the good news: Oceana has terrific oysters and a pasta dish called Squid Ink Paccheri that is just delicious.

"Went here for Valentine's day.  They offered both a fixed menu and the standard a la carte.  Had the lobster scampi with roe infused pasta.  Had the raw bar appetizer sampler.  Everything was delicious.  If I had one complaint, put a bit more lobster meat in the dish for a perfect 5 star.  Loved the appetizer sampler, cerviche was the best.  Wine was excellent and reasonably priced.  Ambiance was excellent, waiter was even better.  He was on the ball with everything, pre-med student going to Columbia.  They did a really nice job at a ""normal"" NYC price (which is why the value can never be above a 3 out of 5 due to NYC prices), but I didn't feel gouged at all for what we got.

I rarely leave poor reviews but unfortunately my experience at Oceana was anything but stellar. I was hosting a business lunch and the service was absolutely awful. We had multiple server switches during our meal and none of the servers took accountability for our table. No one checked on us during the meal and we were unable to get beverage refills. I then had to flag someone down to get our check. Definitely not what I expected from such an elegant and highly rated restaurant.

They had began to set tables in the lounge/bar area. Those tables were nice, however very irritating to be from out of town and make reservation to only have that reservation not accommodated.

The ceviche tacos were the perfect balance of fish and accompaniments. The halibut was fresh and light paired with the avocado and delicious flavors that made for a fiesta in our mouths. Now, the sliders... never did I think I could get nuts, dream about a slider. Itâs happened. You have to try to believe how   scrumptious these little burgers are.

We were wonderfully greeted and our request for a window seat was granted.  Our waiter was superb and could not have been more attentive. He truly was delightful.  The food was fairly good.  My husband had the three chef tastings... which he loved and the lobster which was noted as average.   They do offer a specific vegetarian/vegan menu which I found impressive for such an establishment and the items offered were wonderfully varied.  They were also very willing to modify a dish for preferences.    The restaurant overall was large and open  and the temperature literally was on the cool side.

Truly spectacular food. Outstanding staff and dishes that popped with flavor. Wonderful mix of older standards like the smoked trout appetizer and newer dishes like lobster bolognese and an amazingly entertaining liquid nitrogen popcorn dessert that has to be experienced at least once in your lifetime.

"TL;DR: Food was fine but price/value ratio is unfortunate.  The place was LOUD when we arrived but the maitre'd gave us a booth away from the main area, which allowed for reasonable conversations without raising our voices. The ambiance felt like any of those steak house chains catering to business customers. Service was fine overall. We never felt rushed. The bread was disappointingly bland. Caesar salad appetizer was excellent, a couple more anchovies would have been nice. The sea scallops were perfectly prepared and nicely arranged. Wife's halibut was according to her -- okay. Nothing to write home about. We very much enjoyed the cinnamon panna cotta for dessert but couldn't really taste much of cinnamon in it?! The single glass wine selection was very decent, with good options for every taste.   All in all, we enjoyed our meal, yet the price tag for it did not feel at all commensurate with the value delivered. For that, I'd expect a more pleasing ambiance and a step up in food quality and/or excitement delivered with the preparation.","October 16, 2019",3,4,3,3,"TL;DR: Food was fine but price/value ratio is unfortunate.

"We chose Oceana for dinner in celebration of our wedding anniversary.  We were taking in a show that evening and chose from the theatre menu, which had some very good selections and we also added the wine pairing for each course.  For apps we had the fried calamari and the swordfish ceviche, the calamari were crispy in the outside and tender on the inside.  The ceviche was delicious with just the right amount of acidity and cilantro.  My wife chose the Scottish salmon and I chose the calamari over fresh made spaghetti.  Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.  Our server and the waitstaff worked in well coordinated synchronization to deliver the courses, change out silverware, etc.  Upon discovering it was our anniversary our server, Yamina, she was wonderful, brought us champagne and a special chocolate mousse dessert, aside from our other desserts of sorbets and panna cotta.

For apps we had the fried calamari and the swordfish ceviche, the calamari were crispy in the outside and tender on the inside.  The ceviche was delicious with just the right amount of acidity and cilantro.  My wife chose the Scottish salmon and I chose the calamari over fresh made spaghetti.  Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.  Our server and the waitstaff worked in well coordinated synchronization to deliver the courses, change out silverware, etc.  Upon discovering it was our anniversary our server, Yamina, she was wonderful, brought us champagne and a special chocolate mousse dessert, aside from our other desserts of sorbets and panna cotta.  We left feeling very satisfied and well imbibed !  Thank you to the Oceana team for making our anniversary extra special !"

"Every aspect of our time at Oceana was lovely.  Our table was ready when we entered and the hostess asked if we had theatre tickets and the time, so they could be sure to time our meal accordingly. Which they did with the perfection of a long- studied establishment.  We were asked but not pressured about cocktails -we didnât want to be tired for our show so declined.  The choice to order some dishes as either appetizer or entree sizes was very nice. We chose to order two entrees and share. Each came split to two plates, so we could enjoy the beauty of the playing as well as the food.  We shared the lobster bolognese, which was perfectly seasoned with a floral tarragon and lobster chunks, with a perfectly cooked half a lobster tail on top, and followed with the sautÃ©ed soft shell crab, topped with lemon-included squash ribbons with a crisped potato slice on the side. The crab was meaty and perfectly seasoned with a savory sauce. This was a perfect amount of food for two hungry people with small to moderate appetites.  The amuse-bouche of a cold cucumber soup, garnished with pearls of garlic oil (perhaps grape seed oil?) was refreshing and not overly herbed.  Both the coffee and espresso were delicious and even though we didnât have room for dessert we were served a sweet finish of a tiny raspberry candy and an equally small but delicious lemon merengue. The entire meal was fabulous and, while the noise was deafening in the bar are, the glass wall (which matches the curtains) helped keep the noise level in the dining room to a level where we could carry on a conversation without yelling. It helped that we were seated adjacently, rather than across the table.  We found the prices to be on par or even reasonable for a high end restaurant in New York, but do not mistake that to be âcheapâ by any standard.  Overall, a really wonderful meal, service and food. We highly recommend you dine at Oceana and we will do so again.","August 15, 2019",5,5,5,4,"Every aspect of our time at Oceana was lovely.

"Went to Oceana for a pre-theater dinner based solely on the reviews on OpenTable.  It was fabulous. The decor is very pretty with a lot of wood, tables that are far enough apart that you don't have to worry about overhearing the next table's conversation and nice lighting, unlike the typical pre-theater restaurant in the area. The service was impeccable - our server was aware that we were going to the theater and made several recommendations that would get us out in time.  We especially loved the pre-theater menu which featured three courses with a variety of options at a incredibly low price point.  Everything was very tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.

"Oceana is unique in my experience in balancing a great venue -- soaring ceilings, natural light from the windows on West 49th Street, elegant decor -- with an interesting menu, thoughtful, personal service, a buzzing bar scene, and good food.  Cocktails are beautifully made and the roster changes with the right frequency, so I usually find something new to discover. The front of the house is first rate, too -- everything runs smoothly.  It is perfect for pre-theatre -- even with a 7:00pm curtain, if you mention the timing to the staff you can be confident you will be out the door at the right time. I have never had the prix fixe theatre menu, but that looks interesting. There's also a nice bar menu - a great spot for a lobster roll at the bar.  I love the place and look for excuses to go there. There is usually something to be curious about on the menu -- I just tried the Lobster Bolognese, and it was remarkable; lightly sauced.

"We went to celebrate Father's Day, a day early.  My husband is a seafood lover, me, not so much, but it was all about him.  He ordered crab cakes for an appetizer, of which he's had hundreds over the years.  He said they were ok, but the sauce/veggie thing that came with them was unpleasant tasting, said he wouldn't order again.  He got crispy black sea bass as his entree, on the waiter's recommendation.  Once again, he said the other items on the plate didn't taste good, which affected the flavor of the sea bass.  He actually had a bit of a stomach ache after dinner.  I had a pasta dish with lamb meatballs.  The lamb meatballs were tasty, the pasta was grossly undercooked, and inedible.  We opted not to get dessert, our stomachs weren't feeling the best.   We had to drink some seltzer to relieve the uncomfortable feeling.

"One of our favorite restaurants in St. Petersburg, FL is Sea Salt.  We love seafood, but not prepared as  fried like most sea food places.

It is very well placed on 49th street opposite Rockefeller Center and steps from the theatre district.  The first night we dined there we were just looking for a good seafood dinner but the second night we had to get to a show and the wait staff did everything they could to help out but still provide a full service dining experience.

"Oceana never disappoints. On this most recent visit, we were entertaining dear family friends from Portugal. They were excited by the power-lunch ambience and the range of fresh seafood available. We all went with lunch specials, with the lobster rolls being big hits for our European guests. The decor remains beautiful and the staff attentive but not obtrusive. The price point is a bit high, despite the excellent quality, although comparable to other Sixth Avenue corridor fine dining establishments. We are sure to return yet again in the future.","May 23, 2019",5,5,5,5,"Oceana never disappoints. On this most recent visit, we were entertaining dear family friends from Portugal.

This is our go-to restaurant whenever we are around the Times Square Theatre District area!  It offers the best value with some fabulous food and great service.  Recently we were seated in a lovely back room that was away from the busy main area.  Tables were arranged with wide spaces between them so conversation was easy and we did not have to compete with background noise.  The food here is ALWAYS excellent and we love the pre-theatre menu which offers many choices.

We went to Oceana before the theater at 530 with a show time of 730. We took advantage of the theater three course meal option and ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. The wine was delicious and well priced. The food on the other hand was disappointing. We started with the swordfish ceviche and the calamari. The ceviche was good however some of the pieces were chewy and clumped together.  The calamari was delicious.  For entrees we had the Cod and the lobster for a 15 dollar upcharge. The cod was excellent however the lobster was again disappointing.  Chewy and overcooked. Not what we expected.  Desert was delicious...the lemon meringue. For 200 dollars we honestly expected more.

The restaurant is large, and a bit noisy, but the service was excellent but not intrusive. We were celebrating, so splurged a bit.

"We visited Oceana before a Broadway Show and took advantage of their Fixed Price Theatre Offering which was $49 for an appetizer, dinner and dessert.  It was a wonderful way to experience this restaurant.   Our reservation was at 5:30 and so we had the dining room mostly to ourselves which meant we had all types of servers helping us.  I think we counted six.   The food was delicious and good value for the offering...especially when looking at the regular prices on the menu.  Drinks  and coffee ($6) were expensive but not surprising for this type of restaurant in the city.  Would highly recommend","March 1, 2019",5,5,5,5,"We visited Oceana before a Broadway Show and took advantage of their Fixed Price Theatre Offering which was $49 for an appetizer, dinner and dessert.

"We had dinner here on a cold, windy Tuesday evening; it's a large restaurant and was fairly empty, so my wife and I had a nice, quiet romantic meal. The food was excellent - she had the smoked trout in blini appetizer and I had the yellowtail/uni, and then we each had the grilled cobia for our main - but the surprise was the dessert! She had the lemon meringue concoction and I had the nitro chilled popcorn caramel sundae, and they both were unusual and outstanding.

"Remarkable. Remarkable how they  combine absolutely mediocre food, exceedingly high prices, small portions, poor service, a loud space and a location filled with tourists into one establishment. Having had a good memory of the ""old"" OCEANA, i thought i would give it a try on a night where we had a last minute change of plans and had to eat in midtown.  our first 2-3 dozen choices of restaurants were all booked up.   First, we were seated in an annexed room, off the dining floor. 13 tables--and we were the only diners there start to finish. not exactly what you are looking for in a night out--ESPECIALLY with their prices. The waiter forgot we were there, and we went 40 and 30 minutes stretches without him, finally walking on to the  main floor to retrieve him to get more water. The sommelier poured our wine than stuck the open bottle under her armpit to bring it to an ice bucket. not joking.   I don't care to go on and on about the poor quality of the food, but its kind of like you would expect if you were at an event where they were serving 10,000 people. two crab cakes ordered--little crab, little flavor, deep fried. Gnocchi--the entree portion was in a large bowl and was 3 inches of gnocchi from end to end. also not joking, not exaggerating. had to ask twice for bread. frozen lobster tail on fist sized portion of pasta--$64.   This place captures out-of-town tourists who convince themselves they are having a good meal because they are paying $160/head in midtown manhattan. And maybe if you want to eat in times square, this suits you. For anyone else, there are literally 1000+ better places to eat than OCEANA.

"My mom and I are on a fun mother-daughter trip to NYC to see some shows and I love that the day before our reservation someone from Oceana called to confirm our reservation and that we had a show to get to after our dinner. She said she would make note of that so we could be sure to get out on time.  However, when we arrived, no one once said welcome, we were just shown to our table and waited a solid 11 minutes before anyone even filled our water glasses. That sounds picky, but for a $150 meal, you kind of expect decent service. No one actually introduced themselves as our server so when another man came to take our order, and simply said ""what can I get you"" with no other context, we were a little confused. The sommelier came over when someone brought the wine-by-the-bottle list and then promptly left when she realized we would rather go by the glass, not even offering what glasses would go with our meals.  The food was excellent but for an almost empty restaurant, the service was astoundingly slow and rude. The night before we'd been at an extremely packed steakhouse where our waiter was personable, gave recommendations, and took the time to speak to us. At Oceana, each person that walked by our table hardly glanced at us before moving on to go stand by their co-worker workers and chitchat. Overall, it was a disheartening experience at a restaurant that my parents had once loved revered.","February 5, 2019",3,5,2,3,"My mom and I are on a fun mother-daughter trip to NYC to see some shows and I love that the day before our reservation someone from Oceana called to confirm our reservation and that we had a show to get to after our dinner.

"Iâm struggling to rate Oceana...reasons...  The FOOD was amazing!  Delicious!  Fresh seafood and wonderful dishes crafted by skilled chefs.  Classy joint for food.  The SERVICE was terrible for a restaurant of this caliber.  The waiter neglected the table for 15 mins (my first cardinal rule not to break), didnât introduce himself and simply said âwhat would you guys like to order?â  No explaining the menu, welcoming us, nothing.  When I asked him to explain the menu, he sighed and went through haphazardly for a minute.  He never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything...we were fully neglected.   Then all the sudden out of nowhere another clearly overworked server showed up and said âthe last guy went home, so you got me now.  Can I get you guys some dessert?â  He was admittedly nicer.  But broke my final cardinal rule...I waited 20 mins after I finished dessert to get ahold of him (by waving my hands in the air like a crazy person) to get my check.  By then he knew he had also neglected ya.  No manager came by to check on the meal.  No manager in sight at the time of leaving.  And front desk didnât know where the manager was, and we were late - so we left.  I expect and donât mind this level of lax service at casual table service dining.  I highly recommend a rework of this establishments dining staff to take it up to where it should be to match the quality of the food.","December 16, 2018",2,5,1,4,"Im struggling to rate Oceana...reasons...

I highly recommend a rework of this establishments dining staff to take it up to where it should be to match the quality of the food."

"We hadn't been to Oceana since they moved from the East Side to their current location (120 W 49th St.) The decor is still elegant and the food and service are wonderful, but the ambience isn't as gracious. The old dining room was upstairs and very quiet; the new one is just off the bar and the happy hour noise level on our recent visit was quite high. To be fair, it did quiet down after 7pm, but we miss the relaxed atmosphere of the former location. However, the hostess kindly seated us even though we arrived a full hour ahead of our reservation - we'd gotten tired of fighting the crowds of holiday tourists in Midtown and just wanted to sit down.   I ordered oysters to start; my husband chose calamari. Given that this was my belated birthday dinner, I had caviar toast next. All were fabulous. Ditto my husband's striped bass with spinach and mushrooms and my - wait for it - three-pound lobster. The lobster was perfectly steamed and served with an insane quantity of drawn butter, which isn't really my thing, but when I asked for extra lemon wedges, they appeared almost before I'd finished making my request. The sommelier's wine recommendation was excellent. We didn't order dessert because the sweets on offer were too cutesy for our tastes (ingredients included rice kripsy treats, PB&J, etc.) It's time to put the kiddie food trend to bed.  The kitchen did send out a free chocolate dessert with Happy Birthday gorgeously written on the plate with chocolate sauce - a lovely gesture, but again, the treat didn't measure up to the rest of the meal.   All in all, we had a wonderful time at Oceana and will definitely return.","December 16, 2018",5,5,5,4,"We hadn't been to Oceana since they moved from the East Side to their current location (120 W 49th St.) The decor is still elegant and the food and service are wonderful, but the ambience isn't as gracious.

"Service was excellent.we had a seafood tower but I felt like there should have been more seafood for the price. It needed more clams and maybe two more pieces of lobster. There was also no crab. The ceviche was great and different. You donât usually find that on that dish. Next time get the ceviche sampler, it would have been a better appetizer. The sauces were just eh. Capital Grille has an excellent seafood tower in my opinion.   I had the tuna Wellington which was good but not great. I really did not like the sauces with it. It just was not complementary to the dish. Crust was a little well done, dark brown. Tuna was ok, not very flavorful and a little too thick.   Desserts and wine were excellent.

"My wife, 14 year old granddaughter and myself were in NYC to see Hamilton the night of our dinner at Oceana.  We had a fairly early reservation at 5:45PM.  We were seated promptly and also promptly received menus and a request for any drink orders.   Wait staff was exceptional. It always helps when a waiter smiles and knows when to participate in a conversation when asked. The menu covered all of the possibilities for our small group of three.  We had no difficulty making choices.  Pricing is fair and the food quality and presentation were excellent. We also appreciated that we were asked what time we needed to leave in order to make it to our show at the time we expected.   Yet we never felt that our experienced was rushed in ant way.  All in all we had a wonderful experience and we would hope to dine at Oceana again the next time we travel to NYC from our home in Massachusetts.","November 17, 2018",5,5,5,5,"My wife, 14 year old granddaughter and myself were in NYC to see Hamilton the night of our dinner at Oceana.

"Our experience was a disaster. I dine here with my family and also with business colleagues. Have not been here for a while (summer) but, I go back to when Oceana was still on 54th Street. I love the place for food, ambiance but most of all, quality. I invited a colleague from our Norway location while she was in NYC basically to feed her good food and impress her. We ordered stone crab claws which were good but impossible to eat. The kitchen did not crack them properly and it was ridiculous trying to eat them. I even cut my finger on the hard shell and it was a total mess playing with them by hand. I advised the the waiter and the General Manager, Ryan E. Yeisley told me he would take it off the bill.  The stone crab was substituted with two large prawn which was under-cooked an inedible.   Make matters worse, the swordfish entree came to us absolutely raw in the middle. We departed to eat elsewhere. It was a 100% disaster and I am concerned that one of my absolute favorite NYC restaurants has gone tourist and forgot about us locals. I am trying to see if they are under new ownership or new management because this was not the normal experience I have had through the years at Oceana.

"My girlfriend and I was at Oceana for the tasting menu with the executive chef Bill Telephan . There were 8 other guests. It was on Bastille Day and the menu emphasis was French. We and everyone else thought that everything was beyond extraordinary. Chef Bill was gracious, extremely friendly and especially funny. He is really a wonderful chef and person. Each dish was exceptional.

I had 4 oysters and my wife had a very large order of Calamari. But then we waited, waited and waited for our mains. Finally a runner brought a second round of our first course; we sent him away asking where our mains were. We also flagged down our server. Many minutes later, the mains arrived. My wife's salmon was undercooked; my swordfish was overcooked. Clearly they screwed up. We got apolgies from the waiter and later from ""Eric"" and they took a good discount off the bill.

"My mother and I came here for a weekday lunch, as we wanted something on the healthier side with numerous fish offerings. For lunch, there's a special 3 course menu available for $35, which is what my mother opted for. I ordered a Cobb salad with lobster for my entree. Both our meals were very tasty. I was especially impressed by the dessert that came with my mother's meal-- it was some sort of sorbet with orange flavorings. I was not excited about this dessert as I am generally not a fan of orange in my desserts, nor do I particularly love sorbet. However, this dessert was SO delicious! It was a wonderful medley of 3 different kinds of sorbet/creams. It came in what looks like a stemless wine glass and was mild in flavor and varied in texture-- the creaminess of the sorbet on top, combined with the light cake sponging up the melting frozen toppings on the bottom was absolutely perfect. All items were the appropriate temperature and texture. Really enjoyed this dessert!  My salad was great, except I found a foreign hard unidentifiable item in my salad, which I only discovered after I had been chewing it and discreetly spit it out upon biting into it. Painful and it freaked me out. Service was great but no one asked how our food was, so I never really got the chance to share that this happened, and I felt weird bringing it up out of nowhere.  My mother's starter was the swordfish ceviche-- also tasty and refreshing as well! For her entree she chose the striped bass. This was tasty but seemed a bit off balance, as the fish was appropriately seasoned, and the broccoli rabe was over salted. I'm guessing this was done to balance the flavor of the fish? But still, a good enough dish overall.   I would definitely have given this place 5 stars, had it not been for the weird thing I found in my salad. Possibly would return but would be reluctant to order any type of salad after this experience, especially at $90 for lunch for 2 people.","June 11, 2018",3,4,4,4,"My mother and I came here for a weekday lunch, as we wanted something on the healthier side with numerous fish offerings.

"Very disappointed with service and food.  No black pepper was offered for salads nor entrÃ©es and no waiters nearby to ask for it.  Baby romaine salad had to be sent back as it was filled with sand, literally crunchy and inedible. Clearly the lettuce wasn't washed.  The mixed green salad with lemon dressing was underwhelming, something I'd prepare at home in a couple minutes - not what you expect at a restaurant like Oceana.   Scallop entrÃ©e supposed to be served over polenta but there was hardly any polenta to be found and instead was a soupy texture of some sort. The actual 4 small scallops were good, but way overpriced considering the entire dish.  The bread we started with was delicious!","June 5, 2018",2,2,2,5,"Very disappointed with service and food.

"First, let me say that this fine dining restaurant honored our request for booth or side by side seating which was a great start.  Unfortunately, it went down hill from there.  It took a while before anyone acknowledged our presence or offered a menu to peruse. Finally a server arrived and water and wine were ordered. I inquired about several plates and settled on the local catch called porgy served whole and described as a white fish. When it arrived it looked like it had been massacred on the way to the table. The person delivering the food seemed confused about where the second plate was and tried to serve me the porgy without asking if I would like the head and tail removed.  I promptly asked that the fish be made ready to eat. After he pulled the head and tail off he then took all back to the kitchen to, we presume, find out what happened to the second order. The delivery person then arrived with my husbands halibut order and my porgy, which was lukewarm by then and just looked horrible.  Nonetheless, I opened the fish and found a grey flesh that was anything but white fish.  I ate what I could and was compensated with a small chocolate mousse which is not something that could be eaten with our diet restrictions. So, I would have to say that this was not a very pleasant dining experience and was quite pricey to boot.   As such, we will neither be returning nor will we be recommending this restaurant.","June 2, 2018",3,2,2,4,"First, let me say that this fine dining restaurant honored our request for booth or side by side seating which was a great start.

"Continues to be fantastic! Had dinner with sisters and husband. Loved everything... We started with the cold seafood tower (I believe The Triton, since we were 4). It was perfect; not skimpy at all. Good amount of everything, and everything fresh and chilled. Our entrees were outstanding as well. Enjoyed the varied menu. One sister chose to not have seafood and tried the fillet mignon instead. Totally awesome (and she's a picky steak-eater!). Service was excellent and professional throughout. Oh, and my martini was perfect... Also appreciate the sommelier, who suggested a nice wine. We were hesitant once we tasted it, and she had no problems suggestion another option. However, in the end, we stayed with our original - and were glad we did.

"A rather attractive space with stellar service, it's simply difficult to rave about a restaurant where a $46 fish entree does very little to separate itself from a $25 fish entree elsewhere.  The yellowfin tuna was done extremely well, but even after a $100 gift certificate, the bill came to about $210 with tax and tip (based on the original amount, not the post-GC amount), and we had a comparatively modest bottle of wine for $55.  Again, nothing wrong with the restaurant..it was pretty solid, and the experience was positive, but there are multiple seafood restaurants in NYC I would choose over Oceana, and very few of them have that ""corporate cookie-cutter"" feel for a more upscale restaurant.

"In its newish location, Oceana is a huge step down from its wonderful predecessor!  It now seems to be focused on its noisy and busy bar scene, rather than excellent food. On the positive side, our fresh oysters were delicious, as were the desserts.  The cerviche appetizer and the swordfish main were over-salted to the point that my wife had to return her swordfish.  The main course presentations were careless and uninspired.   The restaurant is cavernous, so the intimate feel of a great restaurant is gone -- hence the loss of the Michelin star.

"This meal was outstanding. Breaking it down:  The food â off-the-charts excellent. The spicing level was just perfect (I rec the bay scallop first course if you want a delicious peppery hum) and all the fish was fresh & accompanied perfectly. Definitely get the Brussels sprouts side; itâs practically Brussels sprouts lovingly coated in bacon fat. We got the bananas foster dessert â super-tasty and the tableside prep was genius.   The service â just wow. Attentive to us and to every little detail (like instantly replacing any utensils removed). Everything was impeccably managed, and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions and answering all of our questions.   Noise level â on a Friday, I recommend skipping the bar area unless you want to shout. The dining room (past the bar) was still fairly loud, but we were able to hear each other.   Price â a little pricey vs the portion sizes, but if youâre having a special get-together, go for it. The food and service are outstanding and make up for the bill.  I canât say enough good stuff â my friend and I would come back here in a heartbeat.","March 16, 2018",5,5,5,5,"This meal was outstanding. Breaking it down:  The food  off-the-charts excellent.

"Disappointing visit. We selected it on the premise it was a seafood and steakhouse. It isn't. The meat selections are incredibly limited.  In terms of the actual experience, the service was incredibly slow. It felt as if no one wanted to pick up our table. (Watching the staff, there were a bunch of huddled conversations but it looked like no one was in charge.)  A server was kind enough to shatter an empty wine glass at the table next to us so the shards ended up all over our table. The garden salad had no real discernable taste. The salmon was fair at best but the polenta it sat on was greasy and likewise had no taste. I have dinner out a great deal and I travel to NYC periodically. I am lucky to have great meals there when I visit. I can safely say that this was probably the most disappointing meal I've ever had at a restaurant in NYC. Ever. Skip this place. Unless you're tourist and want to spend a great deal for a mediocre meal. There are a million other place in NYC where you can spend your food dollars wisely.","December 2, 2017",2,2,1,3,"Disappointing visit. We selected it on the premise it was a seafood and steakhouse.

"Had to wait for 3 steamed oyster appetizers for over 30 minutes.  When I did receive them they were over cooked.

The portions of fish were way too small for the price and with us being from the south, just didn't measure up.

It was pretty bad! The service was broken up a bunch and we held our menus for 45 minutes. The somenlie didnât know much about the wine or seemed pretty disinterested.

I had the tuna nicoise salad as my main....awesome lunch salad... I did notice another table of ladies who ordered the other salads being offered on the menu as well...lighter fare and very appealing to the eye and the tummy.

"We went to Oceana the first evening of a long weekend in New York.  No theater plans for the evening, just wanted a nice dinner near our Midtown West hotel.  So weeks before we researched our options and chose Oceana for reservations.  It was a wise choice, if I say so myself!  Food was great...normally I'm not a big cod fan but I chose it at Oceana for my main course, and it was spectacular.  My wife loved her halibut main course.  Sardines for an appetizer were also very good.  If you like wine, as I do, then you'll have great fun going through their wine list.  Their sommeliers are very friendly and helpful if you need a consultation; I didn't initially, but when my first wine choice (a Chablis) wasn't available, one of the sommeliers came over to offer some alternatives.  I already had a backup in mind, and since it was a Sonoma Chard (very different from the Chablis I had picked initially), I think the boomerang effect nearly broke her neck!  Oh, and I should mention, the sommelier was really customer-service oriented.  She thought she had some of the Chablis in storage and while she looked, she came out with a couple of glasses of house Chablis for us to sip while we waited.  Turns out they didn't have any left; still, everything worked out with the Sonoma Chard and we really enjoyed the dinner.  We heartily recommend Oceana.","November 10, 2017",5,5,5,5,"We went to Oceana the first evening of a long weekend in New York.

My wife loved her halibut main course.  Sardines for an appetizer were also very good.  If you like wine, as I do, then you'll have great fun going through their wine list.  Their sommeliers are very friendly and helpful if you need a consultation; I didn't initially, but when my first wine choice (a Chablis) wasn't available, one of the sommeliers came over to offer some alternatives.  I already had a backup in mind, and since it was a Sonoma Chard (very different from the Chablis I had picked initially), I think the boomerang effect nearly broke her neck!  Oh, and I should mention, the sommelier was really customer-service oriented.  She thought she had some of the Chablis in storage and while she looked, she came out with a couple of glasses of house Chablis for us to sip while we waited.  Turns out they didn't have any left; still, everything worked out with the Sonoma Chard and we really enjoyed the dinner.  We heartily recommend Oceana."

"Worst eating experience we have had in NYC in a very long time. We decided to do the tasting menu, so we were prepared for what we thought would be a fun and delicious dinner. Although we were there early and the restaurant was hardly full, it seemed like the wait staff were overwhelmed. It took more than a 1/2 hour for a waiter to come by to even take our order.  The 1st course arrived and we were a bit shocked. It was just 4 small servings of the various ceviche all in one plate. Not only that, it was just plopped onto the table without any explanation. That turned out to be the theme for the night. Plop & run off, leaving us trying to guess or flag down someone to see what we were to be eating.  Back to the 1st course. We couldnât understand why we were served one plate when we had ordered the tasting menu for each of us. Finally, we flagged someone down to ask (& to ask what it was we were eating), and he said that the opening course was like that and then weâd each get our own meals.  That turned out to be wrong, as the 2nd courses arrived, again 3 plates of various food (think one sardine on a toast), that we were then supposed to break up and share amongst ourselves. Yet, no cutlery was provided for us to make such divisions. Instead sawing into said sardine and toast with a butter knife, which made for a messy table.  The next courses were no better. Three different fish plates, each plate having only one piece of fish smaller than a childâs fist that we were supposed to somehow apportion. The only thing that arrived separately was a poorly cooked soufflÃ© at the end of the meal.  It seemed as if the restaurant wanted to get too many items in front of us, rather than asking, should these things all go on the table at the same time? The answer most times was a resounding âno.â  Octopus with marinara next to brown butter sweet potato pasta next to lobster pasta should have never happened. The waiter came back rarely, he was far too busy to even pour our wine.","November 8, 2017",1,1,1,4,"Worst eating experience we have had in NYC in a very long time.

"I could absolutely kick myself....I worked a block away from Oceana (at Time Inc.) for years, yet never went there.  I am left imagining  all the fantastic meals that I've missed!  From the hostesses, to the bartenders, to the waiters, to the manager....everyone was an absolute joy to interact with.  Our party of three was over an hour late, due to massive traffic backups via the Lincoln and Midtown Tunnel, respectively, AND we had tickets to a concert at Radio City Music Hall.  We were all frazzled but the hostesses and our waiters made us feel like we had all the time in the world, never rushed us or hurried us along.  The experience was sheer perfection.  Our meals were delicious and beautifully presented.  I had the King Salmon Sashimi with watermelon salad and Tuna Tartar....both dishes were most palatable and quite delectable. My friends had the Foie Gras and Lobster and the Halibut...and they both thoroughly enjoyed their dishes.  The bartender created my signature cocktail of Hendricks Gin with muddled jalapeÃ±o.....there are many places that either don't have the peppers or are reluctant to make it.  Not at Oceana!    Do know, that I will return to Oceana.....just so that I can have the dessert that we didn't have time to order or enjoy.

The food was exceptional as usual. The only glitch was that I was served an entrÃ©e I did not order. The waiter took it back and after some time he brought me the right dish. My dinner date waited to eat her dinner until I got mine. She did not want to take the waiter's suggestion to have her plate in the shelf warmer in the kitchen because it would have dried out her food.

"We had a splendid pre-theatre dinner. Our waiter, Rashid, was from Morocco, and he was fantastic! We enjoyed him as much as the meal, and he guided us in ordering delicious appetizers and entrees. We are great fans of all the Livanos Family's restaurants, and this one is simply wonderful. It's a do not miss, and is especially convenient to the theatre district, so that you can have a fabulous unrushed gourmet meal, and still get to your 7 pm curtain. Also, the staff was incredibly helpful. They first seated us at a table next to a very noisy gentleman with a loud booming voice, and they moved us immediately to a quieter spot, no questions asked. They were pleasant and totally understanding.","July 18, 2017",5,5,5,5,"We had a splendid pre-theatre dinner. Our waiter, Rashid, was from Morocco, and he was fantastic!

"First, the food was wonderful.  (and without meaning to sound pretentious, we have eaten at many great restaurants)  Every dish exceeded our expectations; the flavors were deep, and the seasoning perfect.

I had emailed, through Open Table, my friend's issues.  We were shown to a table separated from ta majority of the other guests.

They were never obtrusive, but when my friend ""considered""  fried calamari, the wait person suggested the option of having the calamari grilled.   She loved it.  My husband's oyster  and clam chowder was full of flavor, as was my grilled octopus.  My friend's roasted brook trout was perfectly filleted  and the accompaniments excellent.   She enjoyed the gelatos and was ecstatic over the chocolate  mouse little birthday surprise.  Throughout, the staff were attentive without being intrusive, every dish was right on.

"My sister and I ate at Oceana before seeing a show, and we ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. The food was simply incredible--my sister ordered the market fish, which was salmon, and oh, my, it was simply the best salmon I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Slightly crispy outside, and silky, velvety inside. Just divine. And the dessert! My rhubarb cake was perfection. My only qualm was that the pasta I ordered as my main course was a titch bland, but being from the Midwest, that could just be my underdeveloped palette. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful, constantly making sure we had everything we needed. The service, in general, was quick and smooth.

He acknowledged that we were there for a special night and told us that we would not receive any check for the meal.  He then sent over a nice ""Happy Anniversary""dessert.

Good seafood in an upscale environment.  Very good service.  Nice menu with great seafood selections and some items for landlubbers also.

"This was our first time at Oceana, but definitely not our last. We were seated promptly upon arrival at a very roomy table for two(we were two). The servers asked if we were attending the theater after dinner and what time we would like to be able to leave the restaurant. They made sure that our appetizers, entres and after dinner coffees arrived at a leisurely pace but with enough time to get to the theater without being rushed.  Our appetizers, shrimp cocktail and an assortment of oysters on the half shell, were delicious.  The entres, soft shell crabs and halibut were prepared to perfection.  I don't know why it took us so long to try Oceana, but we will be coming back frequently.","April 20, 2017",5,5,5,5,"This was our first time at Oceana, but definitely not our last.

"My sole complaint about Oceana is that my sister and I, who had reserved a table a week in advance, being two single women, were immediately led to  the very farthest two-top table in the back of the restaurant.  This is a common practice for most restaurants, but was extremely disappointing to us.  We declined to sit at this table and instead chose a four-top table in the very midst of the restaurant where we could see people  and be seen by staff and others.  Apart from this, I have nothing but praise for the rest of our dining experience.  The service was impeccable, with our pleasant, very personable waiter and all attending staff.

"Upon entering Oceana, you are greeted by enthusiastic diners gathered around a cafe and bar, chewing on juicy burgers and crispy, golden fries. To the right is the dining room, which is lavishly decorated and gives off a welcoming vibe with softly glowing candles. The service is outstanding and will take all of your dining needs into account. We were given a basket of warm, homemade bread rolls and butter, and each a crispy bagel wafer with a chunk of smoked trout placed upon it. The grilled octopus with shishito peppers serves as an amazing appetizer, with the meat expertly cooked to perfection. It is placed upon a bed of wilted greens and is incredibly flavorful. For the main course, the smoked brussels sprouts and egg pasta is rich and divine. It is sprinkled with salty parmesan and has a smooth texture and was perfectly seasoned. The wild striped bass was placed atop lobster potato hash, and although the skin was not cooked as well as it could of been, it was quite scrumptious- though not as good as the pasta, in my opinion. The lobster potato hash was textured well and had excellent flavor, but the lobster flavor was not as prominent as it could have been. We did not have time to have dessert, as we had a musical to attend, but, rest assured, we can assume it is quite delicious. The experience at Oceana is one to recommend to your friends; it is a genuinely tasty meal.","March 9, 2017",4,4,5,4,"Upon entering Oceana, you are greeted by enthusiastic diners gathered around a cafe and bar, chewing on juicy burgers and crispy, golden fries.

"I wanted a nice place for a business lunch and I chose Oceana because it was located in midtown west, which was convenient for both of us.  I was pretty disappointed with this place though.  Starting with the food, we each ordered a shrimp salad.  The salads came out about 2 minutes after we ordered them so obviously they just took them out of the refrigerator and served them. They were very cold and the shrimps were ok, but not great.  We both had a cup of regular coffee, and then I asked for the check, which came to $90 including tip.  I actually thought they had incorrectly given me someone else's bill because the high price just caught me off-guard (and I'm a New Yorker).  The server was nice so I guess that is one positive.

However, when there are so many other great business lunch places in NYC to choose from I will not be returning to this restaurant again.  Very overrated!"
"The fish was incredibly fresh.  Both the swordfish and seared tuna were delightful.  The Brussel sprouts, roasted vegetables and lobster fried rice had a bit too much butter/oil but were still very tasty.   The Waite staff could not have been more attentive and full of smiles.

"Got the pre theatre meal. Calamari was tasty but on the salty side. Swordfish ceviche was fresh, light and delicious. Unfortunately, everything after that was disappointing. Calamari and bucatini pasta was ok but very salty. Market fish and broccoli rabe was so disappointing- beautiful filet of fish but poorly seasoned and therefore bland. The broccoli rabe was disgusting, there's just no other word for it. This coming from a person who loves broccoli rabe.  Dessert was equally dissatisfying. Warm apple cake was cold and dry. Ice cream was too hard and cold. Orange creamscicle didn't have an orange flavor at all.  Service was super slow and we were neglected despite being clear we had a show to go to. Our 6pm dinner (we arrived on time) didn't end until 7:45pm and a preset meal.  Very expensive and not worth it.","March 3, 2017",2,2,2,4,"Got the pre theatre meal.

"Most of the dishes were excellent, especially the Hamachi/uni and bay scallop crudos, but there were a couple of slight problems.  The vegetable borscht and smoked sable was not to our liking, and the pace of the meal was way too fast.  We did have a show to see, but the staff did not allow any breathers between courses.  That being said, we would definitely return for the creative and delicious dishes....just try to choose better and request a slower pace.","January 7, 2017",4,4,3,4,"Most of the dishes were excellent, especially the Hamachi/uni and bay scallop crudos, but there were a couple of slight problems.

"My husband and I are always on the lookout for good places to eat in the theater district since we love the theater and hate tourist traps. Being seafood lovers and having had a pretty good business lunch there awhile ago I decided to try Oceana for dinner and we were very pleasantly surprised at how good it is now. They've managed to score the extremely talented Bill Telepan as chef de cuisine after his eponymous restaurant on the UWS recently closed. The menu has been revamped and everything we tried was perfectly prepared and delicious. The setting is attractive and service was attentive and personable. While not inexpensive, the cost is certainly in the right neighborhood for food of this quality. We're pleased to have another great choice in the area.  If you tried Oceana in the past and were not impressed, give it another try.","January 6, 2017",4,4,4,4,"My husband and I are always on the lookout for good places to eat in the theater district since we love the theater and hate tourist traps.

"The menu has changed with the new chef. The pre theater menu is not as broad which is a bummer. Also, key fish favorites are gone and the new items just do not seem to be a step - up so not sure why the change. The Bronzino for two was stuffed with way to much spinach . Visually the dishes could use some color like a roasted carrot- just something given the grey color of fish skin and dark green of cooked spinach . The fish was cooked perfectly as they seem to have mounted that skill set.","January 5, 2017",4,3,5,5,"The menu has changed with the new chef. The pre theater menu is not as broad which is a bummer.

"Had been to Oceana at its original location and am well-familiar with the Livanos group of restaurants. So much wanted this to be a fully-satisfying, if not memorable, experience. Started out well enough; amuse bouche was excellent. Appetizers - tuna tartare was exceptionally good, perhaps the best I ever had anywhere. But it was not enough to bring up the rest of the meal. Caesar salad with anchovy was fine; large leaf lettuce, respectable croutons, decent dressing. Now to main course. Dover sole. $60 on menu. How can any fish restaurant have this be anything less than magnificent? This was a huge disappointment. No flavor. Expected buttery softness. Don't think it was overcooked, but oil ""sauce"" (not sure what it was) didn't help it. It just was ordinary. Ordered side dish of roasted cauliflower. Menu did not describe seasoning. It came out cooked well enough, but there was some kind of spice in there that took over the entire dish and did not suit my taste. Maybe someone else would love it. Finally to dessert. Ordered chocolate souffle. Was happy to wait the stated 20 minutes for preparation. Was expecting a classic French-style souffle, with a sauce that would pour into a punctured center. Instead came with some kind of ice cream on the side and no sauce. Texture of ""cap"" was mealy. Rest of the dish was less than ordinary. Huge disappointment.  Service in one aspect actually was a little over the top.  Three different service people came to the table and asked if we wanted to order a second drink after our initial cocktails. But main server was very competent.  All in all, after such great anticipation, and after so looking forward to a memorable meal, this was a letdown. I am sure the new chef is better than this. Maybe just an off night; everyone is entitled. Do not mind a $260 check for 2 people if the meal is memorable. This was not.

From the welcome, to the bar service before our reservation (generous pours and a great manhattan), to the offer of either a booth or a table (we chose a table), and of course the dinner service - everything was smooth and pleasantly comfortable.  After the amuse bouche of smoked halibut on a light crisp, we shared an outstanding set of appetizers including  colossal shrimp cocktail, meaty crab cakes, chilled lobster, and a dozen oysters. Everything was fresh and generously portioned.  Our main courses were Atlantic bass, striped bass, halibut and lobster bolognese, and  all were delicious and again well-portioned.  The warm chocolate soufflÃ© was among the best any of us had tasted.

We had the ""The Rock"" seafood plateau, and fried calamari to start - seafood was nicely chilled, and very enjoyable - the calamari was without a doubt the best we've ever had - moved on to broiled lobster for her, and the lemon crusted sapphire salmon for me - both done just right, and delicious - ended with the orange dreamsicle parfait, and warm apple cake along with a coffee, and espresso.

"Service was slow.  We were never offered or brought bread until I asked for some to sop up leftover sauce. The bottle of wine we ordered was delivered promptly as were two of the cocktails.  Took about 15 minutes to get a gin and tonic.  The crab cake appetizer was decent but the calamari was mediocre....served with tartar sauce.  Meals ordered were swordfish (dry), scallops (ok), lobster bolognese (overcooked pasta & lobster) and pastrami monkfish (very good). Our waiter rarely checked on us and there were long waits between courses.  We ordered desserts but they were not memorable and less than a week later I've forgotten what they were.  We were visiting New York from South Florida which has many excellent restaurants.  Oceana was very expensive for the quality of food we received.  Would not go back.","December 18, 2016",3,3,3,3,"Service was slow.  We were never offered or brought bread until I asked for some to sop up leftover sauce.

"We really enjoyed this place! We are premium seafood lovers and we find that there are precious few restaurants that truly deliver this. The service here was excellent and the food was awesome. You can order some fish already filleted, or if it's a whole fish they can de-bone and filet for you table-side if you'd like. The service here was very efficient but not rushed. The server was cordial and friendly but not over-the-top.  It is a busy place as most NYC restaurants are. That being said, I am personally stressed out by fast-paced and loud restaurants but this one was not like that at all.  They seemed to have a struck a happy medium here for people like me...not quiet but not loud, and busy but not rushed.

"This is truly a great restaurant. The only reason I gave 3 stars for the food and value was during our recent visit I split the branzino fish made for 2 people with my guest. It was the presentation of that fish that really threw us. It was...grotesque. The whole fish chopped in 4 straight slices across its body. Because it was stuffed so heartily with spinach and mushrooms the fish's body was thick and round so it looked like a body whacked by a machete. It was so hard to look at that each of us ate half of it and then asked to have it wrapped up. We actually couldn't stand the sight of it the next day so we threw it out. $76 for a fish with a very rough,  dark ages kind of treatment to how it was chopped, you could nearly hear how hard the carving knife slammed down on it without any appreciation for its life. Sounds silly, but it ruined an otherwise tasty dish. Presentation matters. Aside from that, I usually have a terrific experience here. This was an odd one off and I hope they rethink their presentation. The dover sole looked more delicate and beautiful.","December 14, 2016",3,3,3,5,"This is truly a great restaurant.

"I went to Oceana to celebrate my birthday.  I was interested in seafood and my sister recommended this place and so we I made the reservations.  Since we both were coming from work via subway The first one in was to get our table-turned out to be me.  While I waited a gentleman came over to check on me while I was perusing the wine menu and i quickly learned he was the sommelier.  We chatted for a bit about what I liked and asked him for some recommendations.  He brought over a sample of  a savignion blanc that I swore I wouldn't like but I was wrong.  Wish I could remember the name.  Anyway, my sister arrived, tried the wine and we irdered it for dinner.  The restaurant serves the theatre district so I was very happy thst the staff asked if we were seeing a show or not so that they could pace the serving of our meal.  The shrimp cocktail was great - they were priced per piece.  We each had 2.  The seared halibut was loved by us both.  The portions were just right.  The ending to the meal was a birthday brownie made special by the chef.  It was the right combination of creamy and fluffy with a whipped topping.  Ut was heavenly.  We are definitely going back and zi eould highly recommend the restaurant.  Just bear in mind it was a bit loud but then again we were having dinner the Friday before Christmas.","December 14, 2016",5,5,5,4,"I went to Oceana to celebrate my birthday.

"I love the ambience and the bar scene at Oceana.  I especially love the fact that they have Blantons on their shelf.  The wait staff and service is impeccable.  I just wish the food would've matched the level of everything else.    Was the food terrible?  No, it wasn't. Did I try everything on the menu?  No, can't say that I did, however what I did try, while palatable, is nothing that I would consider recommending.  If someone asked me if they should have dinner there, I would tell them it's a great place for cocktails, but I wouldn't advise them to dine there.    For my grilled octopus appetizer, I was served the very end of the tentacles and the texture was some how dry and rubbery.  My friend never tried it before and while I would normally be excited that she wanted to try it, I suggested she wait until we had it somewhere else where it was prepared properly.  Her crab cakes were just...okay, nothing to make the palate stand up and take notice.    My entrÃ©e of Striped Sea Bass was prepared well, but it lacked flavor.  I also have a hard time reconciling ""lobster hash"" with squared potatoes with bits of lobster around it floating in the red wine reduction.   When I think of ""hash"" I think of grated potatoes, onions, celery and lobster all cooked together.   Despite having a sauce at the bottom, I needed to request sea salt and cracked pepper in the hopes it would bring the dish to life.  I tried it once again and decided to suffer through it.  I refused to add more salt to the dish.    I also noticed that almost every table in my vicinity requested salt, which seems unusual.  My friend's entrÃ©e, the lobster bolognese was the saving grace of our experience.     She enjoyed her two scoops of ice cream and we got out of there as quickly as possible.  If they ever bring their food standards up to the level of their service standards, they will be Michelin status in no time.","December 8, 2016",5,3,5,5,"I love the ambience and the bar scene at Oceana.

"We have been passing by this restaurant for many years, always curious. With a free evening to go out, I booked dinner there for my husband and I. It did not disappoint.   As soon as we walked in the door, the quiet atmosphere was evident. We were around 30 minutes early however we approached the hostess rather than go to the bar first. We were very surprised to be told they could seat us if we wanted. Most other restaurants send you to the bar first, hoping to get you for a few drinks before dinner. I must state, there were two bars, a main bar where you first walk in  and a secondary bar closer to the dinning room, with a more special vibe.   We sat at a nice table and were pleased to see the tables are decently spaced, where you were NOT on top of the table next to you. We ordered cocktails and then a bottle of wine, shared grilled octopus and got 4 cocktail shrimp. My husband got the grilled dorado and I got the sea bass. All was delicious. For dessert we shared the chocolate bar cake (not sure what it was called).   This was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner with no negativity whatsoever. The prices were moderate and the food excellent.

She literally made a face rolled her eyes at rudely said NO. Then walked away. I had to flag her down to place our order.  She ignored us as if we were cheap so she was not going to waster her time.

The atmosphere was great and the waiter  pleasant. But really stressed the Turbot  Fish that served  4. The fish came and was divided into four even though we were five  and we didn't mind the smaller portions. when we received it it was divided into four but then got the plate unfortunately the fish was awful one out of the five liked it the others thought it was very salty    And didn't taste good. The wild rice side dish was also extremely salty but good. One of the friends had ordered a Dover Sole plate and calamari and really enjoyed that so that was one good review but otherwise 4 out of 6 of us didn't enjoy our meal.

"Firstly,  the addition of Chef Bill Telepan takes this great spot to the spectacular level. We have been following this gentleman chef all over NYC. We have an outside connection as he is the founder/partner chef of the mighty WITS program spreading like love during the holiday season throughout nyc public schools.  What makes this place one of the best is the attention to detail. Not just using the best local products available  but adding superior sauces, food combos that surprise and amaze ones palate. Wines varying in price to cover all the varieties of guest  from one who may choose to come here every other day or one who might visit only on the most special of occasions.  The varieties, as well, cover and accent the vast array of food selections.  I judge every upper tier restaurant by the scene in the ""BigNight"". If ever you taste a particular course or a beautiful combo of courses and you feel the need to pound on the table in reaction to the grandest of experiences you make it your duty to support it. Oceana is the sort of space that may have you feeling a bit outraged the experience is so good. Instead pat yourself on the back. You've chosen well.

"When we learned that Bill Telepan had been hired as Executive Chef at Oceana we were very excited. Having been fans of Chef Telepan from his days at Judson Grill and his own Telepan, we anticipated a wonderful dinner. Chef Telepan's food did not disappoint! His creative, flavorful, but not overly complex approach resulted in a dinner every bit as good as we remembered---except for the service. Granted, Chef Telepan is new on the scene here, and the kitchen may still be in shakedown mode, but that does not explain the disorganized, inattentive service that we experienced start to finish.  Menus arrived promptly, but then our server did not appear again to take our order for nearly 15 minutes, despite the fact that we informed him that we had theater tickets. We ordered from the very nice 3 course prix fixe pre-theater menu and opted for the very interesting wine pairings.  We placed our order, and then waited, and waited, and waited. finally more than 30 minutes after we were seated our first course arrived--wonderful, deep and crispy fried calamari--but no wine! Our server seemed to have disappeared, so we waved down a captain and asked for the first wine, which arrived fairly quickly, but we shouldn't have had to ask at all! Finished with our appetizer, our second wine arrived right away and then--we waited, and waited, and waited--more than 20 more minutes until two servers brought what looked like our orders, and delivered them to the table next to us, only to be told the food had been delivered to the wrong table!  Dessert also took extraordinarily long to arrive, despite the fact that little prepartion needed to be done to either dessert,  and in the end it took over 1 1/2 hours to serve us a meal of dishes that were all rapid preparations!

"The food was good, even innovative in some cases.  The menu has broad ranging seafood options as well as some land based choices, but why are you there if not for the seafood.  Had the pastrami spiced monkfish and a 3 type tasting of ceviche, both very good and would recommend to try.... Service is professional, but waiter liked everything... customers appreciate opinions. 7 oz portion was a recurring theme of description.

"I was late getting to Oceana - and I was meeting M for dinner before going to the theater - so M took my order over the phone and passed it on to the staff ... when I arrived my tuna was done to perfection and my sautÃ©ed zucchini tasted fresh off the stove ... the tuna was served with a spicy salsa on the side - very good. M had a house salad about which she raved (I was concerned about the time since I was late so I skipped salad - I had told M to go ahead and order, not knowing how long it would take to arrive at O given the rain and traffic).  Her Dorado wrapped in pastry was excellent, as was the sauce. M had a martini, I had two glasses of wine; we shared a superb key lime tart with a vanilla gelato; and I scarfed down the little chef's pastries that followed with the bill.

You feel like they are pleased to have you in their room for dinner - and not many restaurants at this level try to do that.

"We chose Oceana because of its' reputation and it's proximity to theatre in NYC.  We were on our way to Hamilton, so it was a special night for us.  We don't mind paying big bucks for a fabulous, special occasion meal, but we did not feel that the food at Oceana met our expectations.  We shared two appetizers, which were forgettable.   We both ordered the General Tso's Lobster, which is a signature dish of the restaurant.  It was recommended by the server.  The sauce was a gooey, gelatinous mess.

"We had a fantastic ""special occasion"" meal at Oceana -- our annual treat of the grandparents to a Broadway show (Hamilton) and post-theater dinner.  While expensive, the service and the food lived up to the price tag.  The service was highly attentive and super-friendly.  The food was appetizingly presented and delicious.   The staff and kitchen was very accommodating of our children's food allergies, and were able to prepare menu entrees and side dishes with minimal changes to remove dairy and gluten.  In fact, without our asking, the kitchen sent out two specially-prepared plates for the ""amuse bouche"" so that our daughters would not have to sit there and watch the rest of the table enjoy a course.  That may have seemed like a small gesture for the kitchen, but for myself and my wife it made the entire meal.  Thank you, Oceana.","September 10, 2016",5,5,5,5,"We had a fantastic ""special occasion"" meal at Oceana -- our annual treat of the grandparents to a Broadway show (Hamilton) and post-theater dinner.

"This is a really special place.  The atmosphere was lovely and welcoming.  Service was beyond attentive without being intrusive.  We were brought bite size tastes of what the chef was making once we ordered our dinner.  Lovely bites......  Our meals were beautiful in presentation, impeccably cooked.  I had the tuna dish and I must say, I have never had tuna at this level before.  It was beyond perfectly cooked....each bite was an epiphany.  The very, very best tuna I have ever had, bar none.  Loved the atmosphere, the ambiance, the attentive waitstaff.  All in all this was a delightful experience that I hope to repeat again.","August 30, 2016",5,5,5,5,"This is a really special place.

No crab meat no lobster just some clams, shrimp, mussels and some salads from tuna, salmon and shrimp. The ceviche we ordered was delicious. For entree we ordered the soft shell crabs and scallops. The crabs were equal to the ones i get from a local sushi place, fried with no seasoning or sauce. It was just 2 crabs fried and cut in 4 pcs.  The scallops were blend and only sautÃ©ed on one side.

We had a noon reservation, the server was excellent and helpful and actually dissuaded us from ordering too much food!  I had the fluke crudo and both my Mom and I had the monk fish with morels and both were excellent!  My dad had the salmon gravlax salad, I think it was a small plate, and it was ample and delicious.

The place became full as we dined and it was louder but not so much that we couldn't talk , it was fun and lively.   Its primarily a business lunch crowd with some lucky tourists sprinkled in.

"I have hosted a couple of private dinners in the wine room at Oceana and was wowed by the quality of the food. Especially the fish of course. This was a different occasion as my fiancee was visiting from London and I wanted to take her to an excellent (fingers crossed) mid-town restaurant. After enjoying cocktails at the rooftop Press Lounge we wandered over to Oceana. It was a Friday night. Just opening the menu thrilled me with the raw shell fish options, lobster and wide range of premium fish. The wine list is pricey but there are some great value options too. I picked the Macon villages from domaine heritiers du comte lafon. An excellent wine for $60 or so. My fiancee loved the luxury version of clam chowder they serve in Oceana and my platter of raw middle neck clams and steamed green lip mussels was superb. The entrees, of lobster and halibut were both wonderful. A superb restaurant.

"We had a 5:15 reservation on a Friday evening (as we had theater tickets and wanted to make sure we had sufficient time).  The reason for our visit was to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday with a night on the town.  The bar scene was loud ... too loud.

Dessert -- we had one order of ice cream and one of the pretzel/potato chip/caramel tartlets -- both were delightful.  We did have one bottle of wine and two cocktails ($16 a piece for a gin and tonic -- wow).  Overall, for $350 dollars, we both agreed it wasn't all that we expected.

"This was a special birthday occasion and it was absolute perfection!  We were able to get a reservation relatively easily for the time we needed and enjoyed an early dinner.  The food was absolutely delicious - from the bread all the way to the desserts!  I had the grilled halibut and my husband had the hangar steak. The service was excellent - just perfect - never left you needing or wanting anything, but not hovering or intruding in your space.  It was one of the best, if not THE best dining experiences we have had.  We would highly recommend this restaurant and know you would not be disappointed.

"Maybe the regular chef was off or the menu has been changed, because Sunday night the branzini for two was bland and tasteless.

Restaurant was half empty but they claimed there was a party and they were backed up.  Wasn't worth sending dinner back because it too so long and we needed to get out of there.

I would say this place is good during the week because it is a busy and a good corporate stop but would say to avoid on the weekend completely.  Lackluster food, poor service and an expensive bill not worthy of the fare."

We chose this restaurant because it was near the theater and we like fish. The food was good but there were problems. The calamari came with some kind of bone in it which is odd because squids don't have bones. I ordered a glass of red wine and it came with part of the cork in it. Basically the food was good but the mishaps put a damper on the  dinner. Originally they didn't do anything not even a real apology but then the manager came by and took the wine off the bill.,"April 9, 2016",2,3,2,3,We chose this restaurant because it was near the theater and we like fish.

"Visited Oceana before a Broadway show on a Saturday night.  We arrived a little before 6 and the restraurant was empty, but quickly filled up to capacity. Even with a large crowd, our food arrived promptly and in plenty of time to get to the show. We started with a half portion of the Poseidon Tower which was the perfect amount for four. We didn't see this option on the menu, but our waiter mentioned the half-size and we're really glad he did. The specialty cocktails are unique and refreshing, and all our entrees were appropriately portioned and delicious.","April 2, 2016",5,5,5,4,"Visited Oceana before a Broadway show on a Saturday night.

I decided to take my wife here for our anniversary as we were visiting NY and she loves seafood . She got the blackened Mahi mahi which she said was the best ever. I'm a vegetarian and was happily surprised that they had a separate menu. However the orange chinese vegtables were not so great and Salad looked like bagged lettuce which was pretty disappointing for such a nice and expensive restaurant though the sample soup from the chef was awesome! . Our server was not quite up to par as he did not introduce himself and we thought he was the person who just first greets you(which he didn't do either. lol) They did take great care of us with free champagne and desserts for our anniversary and the I would go again but maybe stick to the seafood since that is what they are known for :),"March 29, 2016",4,4,4,4,I decided to take my wife here for our anniversary as we were visiting NY and she loves seafood .

"We arrived and were prompty seated in their lovely dining room. The calamari appetizer was one of the best that I have ever had. My main course was Seared Yellowfin Tuna, it was prepared just right and was delicious.

Wood highly recommend for the seafood person who likes to have selection and a different kind of seafood. We had non seafood and seafood lovers and the food was amazing! Only thing that could be better was our server and the staff switch or went on break half way through and no one told us... and we kind of got lost in the shuffle.. food didn't stop coming out and such but really like the first bus person and server ...,"February 7, 2016",5,5,3,5,Wood highly recommend for the seafood person who likes to have selection and a different kind of seafood.

"My wife and I, approaching wonderful 40 years, this year, do enjoy fine dining. Oceana fit the bill for our dining out in NYC on a Saturday nite..Their diversified menu is not overwhelming to choose from. The choice of an al la carte dinner, as an option, being able to select individual sides, worked for us. My wife had the Lobster, and I the Cod, both fresh and cooked to perfection. East coast oysters, to start, set the evening dining pace. Service was attentive and professional.

"My husband and I were visiting NYC for a night at the theatre and had dinner at Oceana before the show. Unfortunately, our table for two was just right outside the kitchen door and the location was not ideal--very busy and noisy.  That being said, it was the only negative of the night. Our server brought us a delicious warm soup amuse bouche from the chef. We then moved on to oysters--all East Coast--and they were wonderful. We shared the calamari appetizer.  This is a staple on almost all seafood restaurant menus, and we have had it countless times. But we have never had better--perfectly breaded and fried, with a wonderful sauce. For our entrees, we had the yellowfin and the General Tsao's lobster, both inventive and delicious. My husband had banana ice cream and grapefruit gelato for dessert, which I tried. Yummy. WE were also brought tiny gelees and meringues. A very nice end to the meal. Service was prompt and helpful, but never intrusive. If you go, try the plunge cocktail, grapefruit and vodka.  It was perfect with the meal, and proceeds go to a lung transplant charity.","February 6, 2016",5,5,4,3,"My husband and I were visiting NYC for a night at the theatre and had dinner at Oceana before the show.

The parsnip and eggplant ravioli was  unbelievable--my mouth is salivating just thinking of it. The halibut with black tahini was most unusual. The flavors of the sorbet were not to our liking.

"Large establishment with little warmth. Food price fixe pre theatre was not very interesting nor very good. The calamari was tough, tasteless and over cooked. Sauce was a dull tartar that lacked interest. The oysters also didn't live up to the hype. Our main course was salmon that was equally blah and not well seasoned. The worst were the sides. Roasted brussel sprouts tasted over charred and lacked distinctive seasoning. The smashed potatoes were equally bad and the seasoning lacked  a good flavor.

I have nothing specific to complain about ..... but nothing really sticks out as special, memorable, or worth going back specifically to re-experience.

"The pre fixe Feast of the Seven Seas was really not what we had in mind for a traditional Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Seas. We made a reservation after hearing so many wonderful things, but the food was quite bland and had incredibly off pairings.  We found the first course, the soup, to be bland. While the second course of fish was very tasty. The gluten- free apple risotto that I had was bland, while my fiancÃ©e had the seafood pasta and it was great. The main entree was just a terrible disappointment; I can never imagine a time when it would be appropriate for potatoes and scallops to be combined together as one dish.  The dessert was delicious, both the pre fixe peanut butter dessert and the gluten- free chocolate soufflÃ© option. The earl grey tea and coffee were both wonderful, as was the champagne.  But for us, the few highlights are just not enough for us to return. My fiancÃ©e and I are foodies, but the meal left many things to be desired.

"I was a little peeved that we had an early dinner reservation and yet were shown to the only table next to the kitchen in an empty room when the dining room didn't even start to come alive for at least another hour.  And instead of just moving us to the next table down, the host had to ""go check with the front desk"" to see about another table.  I mean, this was 5pm!  Really?  That many people clamoring for a table? That said, once seated, the experience was very good.  The room is large, but doesn't feel cavernous.  It's modern and clean but not austere.  The service was present but not over-bearingly so.  Service may have been the best part.  The oysters seemed a bit rubbery and old.  The seafood trio had the best smoked salmon I've had in ages, but the octopus terrine was a bit gelatinous.  We all had fish and all were cooked perfectly. The sauces were a little lacking , mostly in volume.  The Hollandaise was more buttery than lemony, the Huli Huli sauce, not saucy at all.  All in all, I enjoyed the experience, but for the price, it should deliver a perfect meal, not just a nice one.","December 24, 2015",3,3,5,5,"I was a little peeved that we had an early dinner reservation and yet were shown to the only table next to the kitchen in an empty room when the dining room didn't even start to come alive for at least another hour.

"Very good pre-theatre pre-fixe dinner.  They even added an ""amuse"" and some petits fours to the 3-course meal.   Started with 4 oysters each. My husband's roasted calamari was very good.  My roasted cod could have used a more exciting sauce --- the tomato sauce served on the side was too bland.  Wine by the glass was over-priced, but all else was good value.  Liked that the sides were served in separate containers so we could share the smashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.  Service was very prompt.  We arrived at 5 pm for a 7 pm curtain and were out with  more than 1/2 hour to spare.","December 22, 2015",4,4,4,4,"Very good pre-theatre pre-fixe dinner.

"I wish I could write a raving review on this restaurant, as the food here was actually amazing, however the service at this restaurant was so poor, I would never recommend this place to anyone.  Our hotel concierges recommended Oceana to us, so naturally we thought it would be great.  WRONG!  Our concierges contacted the restaurant to let them know we were their guests and celebrating something special this evening, and requested the restaurant do something special for us (complementary champagne, special seat with a view, something).  The restaurant in fact decided their idea of ""something special"" was to barely even acknowledge our table.  Our waiter was very short and almost rude, the manager barely even spoke to us when he stopped by our table and the sommelier all nicely dressed in a suit pre bussed our table and didn't even speak one word to us.  I actually was very awkward how it seemed they were trying to avoid us. Talk about pure discrimination!  The mere fact that they knew we were using our hotel food vouchers at their restaurant must have given them a reason to treat us as if we were homeless people off the street.  It actually became very comical as the evening progressed to watch how they interacted with other tables and did not even speak to us.  We even expressed our disappointment to our waiter and to the hostess, whom we saw them speak to the manager about it, and the manager did not have the decency to even come by and apologize.  We would have gladly stayed and enjoyed a dessert and more drinks at this restaurant had we felt welcomed, but we decided to enjoy a nice piece of cheese cake from Juniors (this place was awesome with amazing service!) and we went to the bar on top of Rockefeller center where we had a few nice drinks with an amazing view!

"A wonderful surprise in the heart of Times Square. Unlike many catering to the typical tourist, Oceana was overall a great experience.

"My fiancee and I went to Oceana for dinner on 10/23. The hostess was aware we were heading to a show after dinner, and seated us promptly on arrival. Over the next 10 minutes, we had 4 different staff approach our table, one of which was the sommelier who was very nice and informative. The second server was very also helpful and provided recommendations on entrees from the menu. However, no one mentioned the more affordable theater menu option. We only saw this by finding the theater menu beneath the wine list. When we mentioned this after our orders were placed the server  said he would check with his manager on what he could do for us. After the entree, which we enjoyed, the sommelier returned and recommended the Rum Caramel & Hot Fudge Sundae. Shortly after ordering, an order of the cheesecake was brought to our table (neither of us care for cheesecake). After receiving the bill, we noticed the cheesecake was not on there which means the complimentary cheesecake ($12) was the manager's idea of how to make up for the difference in price of our meal ($220) and the theater menu ($160). Though the gesture was appreciated, we would have preferred an apology for not making us aware of the theater menu (which the server later acknowledged was because he was assisting our original server) or some other gesture besides additional dessert (we typically don't order one dessert, let alone two). We really enjoyed the food but most likely wouldn't return or recommend to friends due to the level of overall service.","October 23, 2015",3,4,1,3,"My fiancee and I went to Oceana for dinner on 10/23.

We shared a berry souffle dessert with our coffees. Overall, a memorable special meal for us.

"We have eaten at Oceana every time we go to New York (which is now about 12 times).  We always look forward to our meal there each time.  It just gets better and better.  They have had the same head chef, Ben Pollinger, since they opened.  We feel he is one of the best Chefs in the country.  The food is creative, delicious and fun.

"We wanted to do something really special for our last night in NYC.  We had walked past Oceana before thought it looked very elegant and it was. A vast choice of seafood on menu and a knowledgeable server led us to excellent choices of crab cake appetizer, seared scallops, creamed spinach, and a mild fish filet.  The servings were adequate in size and very delicious.   White wine, great coffee and amazing cheesecake with raspberries and fig sauce finished the evening.    All in all a wonderful  evening highlighted by superb service in beautiful setting.   This was a special occasion so we did not mind spending about $150 total.","September 27, 2015",5,4,5,5,"We wanted to do something really special for our last night in NYC.

"My wife and I made reservations for 8:00 on a Saturday. The restaurant was not extremely busy and we actually were seated early. The food was fine. We had oysters from around the northeast. There wasn't a description of the flavors on the menu...only location. Some restaurants include if the oysters are bruny, buttery, etc. We took a chance. They were served with nothing but lemon. This is when our trouble started. The waitress did not come back to check on us. Not once. Our food was brought by food runners. Our entrees were brought by runners. Water and butter brought by bus boys. No server to ask for salt for the creamed spinach. No salt and pepper on the tables. We were disappointed in the flavors of some of the food and had no way of requesting salt or other condiments to help. I had the General Thao's Lobster. Pretty tasty. The other food was marginal. I will not go back or recommend.","September 27, 2015",3,3,1,4,"My wife and I made reservations for 8:00 on a Saturday. The restaurant was not extremely busy and we actually were seated early.

"Pro's: Lovely room.  Con's: Service staff is rough around the edges. Waiter describes dishes on menu and says ""OK"" after each item like a tween.

The Captain stood and watched, obviously distressed, but should have stepped in. Then the stuffing was barely room temp and inconsistently overly seasoned with black pepper.

When we were ordering dessert, the Captain returned to ask if he could comp us dessert and sparkling wine. He asked if we had any dietary considerations, but not what we were going to order.

"Despite for some reason our waiter changed a few times, the service was fantastic from everyone we saw. The complementary bread was DELICIOUS! All the plating was simple yet beautiful. The oyster week special was of special tomato sauce over baked oyster, nicely plated, just not my favorite flavors. The lunch set was well worth the cost. Also, even though my party of 2 shared one lunch set, the meal was nicely splited and plated for us. We had the salmon sashimi appetizer, pan fried salmon main course, and blood orange sorbe from the lunch set. As well as 3 sides of mushrooms, cream spinach, and potato gnocchi. And everything was nicely done! Pan fried salmon was nice and crisp on the outside, while juicy and tender on the inside. Cream spinach has a surprising hint of lemon, even though I like creamier spinach I didn't mind this one. Gnocchi is very cheesy and satisfying. The sorbe was nice and sour, we used the cookies on the side to decrease the acidity when needed, wonderful way to clean the palette after meal. Drink wise we've tried a virgin ocean breeze, refreshing but a little disappointed that ""ocean breeze"" doesn't have a hint of salt.

"We eat here as often as we get to midtown west.  Combination of food and service is as good as any restaurant in NYC.  The service is better than anywhere we go, and that includes some top City reputations.  The training is extremely good and management's expectations are very high.  The attention to detail is surprising - and everyone in your area kicks in.

"Top notch customer service. You know from the recommendations that the waiters and connoisseurs knew what was good and what wasn't. We had the Dr. Von Bassermann Riesling from Germany along with the largest seafood tower, crispy fried soft shell crab, halibut with corn puree, and squid ink pasta. The tower is just worth the stares. However, I recommend ordering what you want instead because it comes with stuff like small snails, escargot, fish ceviche that only appeal to some taste buds. The oyster and clams were very fresh. The other dishes were good but the halibut was a bit overcooked. For dessert, we had the pistachio item and the sundae. You have to get the pistachio! It's light and not overly sweet. During the night, we had multiple complimentary items like carrot root shooters, tartare, and meringue/jelly bites. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.

"I have a somewhat rare dietary issue---hereditary fructose intolerance---that makes most sugars dangerous to me.  This presents problems with modern chefs who often include sugar, honey, syrups, fruit, fruit juices, or sweet vinegars and wines in their dishes or sauces.  Oceana's menu includes a list of sauces one may choose from to garnish otherwise simple meat and seafood items, one of which I was very interested in.  All of the sauces contain some kind of sweetener, which I often encounter.  What I also usually find in finer restaurants, however, is a willingness in the chef to be a little creative and come up with a savory version of a dish or sauce or even an altogether new sauce.  At Oceana, the server was quite flummoxed by my issue and wasn't even willing to talk to the chef about adjusting one of the proffered sauces.  I had to go through all of the other sauces apparent on the menu---for appetizers and side dishes---with him, figure out which one would be safe and an appropriate complement, and ask for one of them on the side.  Given the self-proclaimed caliber of Oceana's head chef and the price point of the a la carte menu, I would expect it to be less work for someone with a dietary limitation to enjoy a meal there.  By the way, the wasabi aioli from the appetizer menu is an excellent accompaniment for the really wonderfully prepared Spanish octopus.","August 4, 2015",4,4,3,4,"I have a somewhat rare dietary issue---hereditary fructose intolerance---that makes most sugars dangerous to me.

For dessert, they surprised us with a chocolate mousse cake, a perfect combination of luscious textures with a creamy chocolate layer, then the mousse filling and a nice crunchy bottom.

"The staff was perfection. Attentive and supportive throughout without being overpowering. Perhaps my expectations were too high due to the Michelin Star and having dined at many throughout the world. The wine list although extensive but seemed above market which I expected so close to Times Square and Rockefeller. I did enjoy the Southern Rhone wine but had to pay to do so. The lobster boil was bland and the quality was lacking such that it could not make up the lack of quantity. It left two in our party hungry even after an assortment of starters. The flat iron steak should just be avoided. At medium rare it was charred on the outside and very rare in the inside. Our party member attempted to eat it, finally gave up and shared samples with the table that no one enjoyed and left to buy a meal at another restaurant.","July 2, 2015",2,2,5,4,"The staff was perfection.

Two chose the prix fixe options which had a variety of choices for a reasonable price. Two chose fresh fish which you can pair with a tasty group of sauces .Try the amazing bagna cauda.  From the crispy fried calimari and spring vegetable consume as appetizers to start to entrees that included salmon, halibut, and a whole dorade, as well as a hanger steak, everyone was satisfied. My favorite side was the tricolor cauliflower. Despite how busy the restaurant became, the service was very friendly and attentive.

"We had a very satisfactory experience at Oceana for dinner on a Saturday night.  The ambiance and decor are understated in a semi formal way and the space is large enough so that the tables are adequately spaced.  Service was very efficient, ,attentive and pleasant; we were seated as requested at a relatively quiet table at the back,so we could converse comfortably with out of town visiting friends.  The calamari appetizer was okay but could have been better if it was a little fresher  - it seemed as if it might have been fried and reheated.  Cod was delicious.  General Tso's lobster, which is a specialty, was very good; however the sauce was a bit too thick and overwhelming and I left most of it on the plate.   The lobster chunks really didn't need very much of it to get the intended effect.  We enjoyed the cookie plate for dessert and recommend it as a light but interesting mix of small artisan type creations.  Perfect with coffee or espresso after a satisfying meal.","May 23, 2015",3,3,4,5,"We had a very satisfactory experience at Oceana for dinner on a Saturday night.

"I've held a number of business lunches at Oceana.  The venue offers a great atmosphere, consistently fresh and delicious food, and a great wine list.

The fois gras appetizer is world class and the chestnut pasta with scallops was not far behind. Entrees were delicious grilled salmon and wonderful grilled calamari in  a perfectly spiced mildly hot preparation. Desserts did not disappoint either. Our pre-theater dinner was timed perfectly.

Everyone from our waiter and assistant waiter to the matre 'd/manager were very attentive, helpful, and courteous.  As they were aware that it was my wife's birthday, they brought us complementary Moscato with our dessert, much to our surprise.  Just a very pleasant experience from beginning to the end."
"Oceana is a beautiful restaurant, immaculately decorated with superb service but while you can go for the ambience, the real reason must be the superb fish and seafood, simply prepared or complex with a wine list of great depth to match the food.

"We had an early lunch at Oceana, being one of the first guests to arrive at opening time of restaurant.  Maitre D had noted our request on our Open Table reservation and was ready with seating us in the requested area.  Our server was 100% about accommodating our wish to be served at a relaxed pace, despite the more typical speed of lunchtime business diners.  He was completely knowledgeable about our preparation questions and able to advise us.    The food was really terrific.  My companion selected the Prix Fixe lunch which offered 3 options for each of 3 courses at a most reasonable $35.    I had a root vegetable salad expertly prepared, followed by an excellent  lobster sandwich prepared with bacon and avocado on thin foccaccia so the sandwich was easily edible in tact: it's size was because of the generous amount of Maine Lobster, not because of thick bread.  The sorbets we each had for dessert would have been fit to serve as models for a watercolor painting, the flavor options creating a pastel  ""pear-shaped"" rainbow.  Oceana is definitely a top-notch restaurant I will eagerly return to on my trips to Manhattan.  May they live long and thrive!","March 18, 2015",5,5,5,5,"We had an early lunch at Oceana, being one of the first guests to arrive at opening time of restaurant.

"The restaurant is very pretty, the service attentive. Not really impressed with the chef. Had the special Paella for 2. The rice was cooked just right (which is often not the case with paella), but the seafood was very sparse. 1 clam and 1 oyster each, and a few small baby (frozen?) shrimp. Should not be considered a ""signature dish"". Wine list was nice, albeit full of very expensive wines. Not too many reasonably priced ones. Nice place, but probably won't return. Didn't think it was worth the cost.","March 14, 2015",3,3,4,4,"The restaurant is very pretty, the service attentive. Not really impressed with the chef. Had the special Paella for 2.

"The restaurant is huge, but dining seemed almost intimate.   The waiter was very knowledgeable and very helpful.  The menu, when examined closely, provided many options, so you could order combination plates prepared by the kitchen or you could build your own dinner (starting with a good size piece of fish of your choosing).   There was a varied dessert menu, but we asked for a fruit plate and they presented us with a beautifully sculptured plate of really excellent fruit.  It really topped off the meal.  It was really an excellent dining experience.  Prices were a touch high, but the experience seemed worth it.","March 14, 2015",4,4,4,4,"The restaurant is huge, but dining seemed almost intimate.

"I have dined at Oceana both for lunch and dinner, and have never been disappointed...until now. A friend and I had pre-show lunch there recently and we were both looking forward to the fabulous seafood that Oceana does so well. I must say that upon arrival, the service was fast, polite, and smooth. We were seated in minutes of our arrival and the waiter immediately asked us if we were going to a show (so he could time our dining experience effectively). The service was more than efficient with refills on our iced tea drinks happening almost faster than we could sip the drinks. However, it was the food that caused the disappointment. I ordered a root vegetable salad, which was beautifully presented, but extremely bland. We both ordered the Tagliatelle with seafood in a chestnut sauce, and counted just 4 small scallops in the dish. In addition, the chestnut sauce was too sweet & overwhelmed the pasta. The sauteed mushrooms, ordered as a side, were also bland and rubbery, and we left half the dish after we had finished (something we mushroom lovers never, ever do). I will say the unique bread that arrived with our appetizers was delicious! The bottom line is that although Oceana is a great restaurant for airy space and fabulous service, the food was just so-so, as if the restaurant's chef has lost his/her passion!","March 11, 2015",3,2,5,5,"I have dined at Oceana both for lunch and dinner, and have never been disappointed...until now.

"We had a fabulous meal at Oceana for my birthday.  Of special note was the seafood ""Schlachtplatte"".  It sounded odd (sauerkraut with fish sausages?) but tasted delicious and was very light.  I had a nicely prepared cod.  We shared two appetizers which were likewise delicious.  The white sea bass ceviche was more of a carpaccio, beautifully plated.  The rainbow trout tartare came with a fun mix of accompaniments.  The only complaint I had was that we were stuck at a table right in front of the kitchen doorway (no door), so staff were zipping through and the noise from the kitchen, which is open to the dining room, was distracting.  Of course, we went pre-theater on a Saturday night, so it was quite full.  But do try to be seated further into the middle of the room.

"I brought my husband here for his birthday before going to see a Broadway show. The service was prompt without feeling rushed and the food was exceptional. We had a dozen oysters and a cocktail, and then each ordered off the theatre menu. We also opted for wine pairing. The wine that came with the entree was not to my liking, and when I asked the waiter, he was so gracious, listened to my wine preference, and brought us an outstanding alternative. We made it out in perfect time for the show -- and we didn't watch the clock as the servers were clearly doing this for us. My only complaint is probably that you are seated right next to other tables, so there isn't a lot of privacy in the main dining area. This would in no way deter me from going back again though.

"This was the 3rd in a flurry of pre-theatre dining expereinces in the past two months and by far the best.  In fact it was flawless, and unlike the other two, there was no sense that this was a pre-theatre dinner.  While the waitress was aware that we had an 8:00 curtain at a nearby theatre,  our meal was perfectly paced to our liking, not the ""cookie cutter"" pre theatre, rushed pacing at the other restaurants where we recently dined.  The decor of Oceana is beautiful, with soaring ceilings and tables spaced well apart.  The food was outstanding, with a lovely variety of choices on the menu.  The supporting wait staff was excellent, attentive but not hovering.  And we cannot say enough about the skill of our waitress!!  We dine out weekly in NYC, Westchester and Greenwich, CT in top notch restaurants and have been to fine places around the country; she is probably the best server we have had.  She was always there exactly when we needed her and knew her food and wine menu well.  She also redirected us from a combination of appetizers we initially were going to order for the purpose of enhancing our meal.  Because we hadn't actually asked for the recommendation she was quite diplomatic when making the suggestion.  We could see as soon as our plates were placed down that she was correct.  We look forward to returning to Oceana soon!","February 28, 2015",5,5,5,5,"This was the 3rd in a flurry of pre-theatre dining expereinces in the past two months and by far the best.

Also the Jumbo Lump Crab Meat wrapped in Sole.  Just delicious!  And they do mean JUMBO!  The chucks were large and tender and tasty!  We ended with the pumpkin cheesecake and some kind of marshmallow lava cake concoction that was heavenly.  After dinner while chatting with one of the managers during one of his many trips to our table he offered for us to meet the chef, which of course we took him up on!  Chef Pollinger was gracious and kind, even offering up other restaurant recommendations in the area while we were here visiting.  Overall amazing experience.

We went for dinner on Valentine's day before a show, and this meal kicked off our night in a wonderful way.  Started off with a raw tower, picked our own pieces at the suggestion of the waiter and were glad we did.  Would recommend to just be aware of the price per piece.  For dinner, had one of the specials - Kamasutra of dover sole and king crab legs in a caviar champagne sauce. So tasty, and set the mood for an enjoyable evening. My husband had a grilled dorade which they filleted tableside.  He did find one bone in the fish, but overall the fish and sauce selection was delicious.

"A group of us had dinner at Oceana on a Saturday evening after a matinee.  We had a very comfortable table for six in a corner.  Conversation was easy, as the noise level was only moderate, even as it got more crowded as the evening progressed.  The seafood was very fresh and excellent.  Two of our party had beef and said it was very good.  The service was attentive, friendly, and not rushed.  There were two waiters taking orders for drinks, glasses of wine, etc., which did get a bit repetitive.  While Oceana is not a bargain, the quality of the food, portion sizes and price were appropriate for dinner at a nice restaurant in NYC.  The pre-theater prix fixe dinner was well priced.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable evening.","February 7, 2015",5,5,4,5,"A group of us had dinner at Oceana on a Saturday evening after a matinee.  We had a very comfortable table for six in a corner.  Conversation was easy, as the noise level was only moderate, even as it got more crowded as the evening progressed.  The seafood was very fresh and excellent.  Two of our party had beef and said it was very good.  The service was attentive, friendly, and not rushed.  There were two waiters taking orders for drinks, glasses of wine, etc., which did get a bit repetitive.

"Went for pre-theater dinner. Food was delicious as always. Service was swift but not rushed and had us out in plenty of time to make our showtime. Accommodated gluten-free requests, even for dishes containing soy sauce, which was much appreciated.

"We've been to Oceana and regularly go to their two Diners ""City Limits"".  The ownership concentrate on really good food, really good service and opportunities to enjoy your meal.  Your treated with honest respect, good training of the Staff and they assist each other to make sure the customer is always center of attention.  We visited for a pre-theatre dinner, even though they were not yet full we were placed in a noisy area.  When asked, they no-fuss, no-muss put us in a quieter place.  There are many restaurants in NYC, some are particularly great but require either an in to get a reservation or very much advanced planning.  Regarding those that are not of that upper class and are near to the theatre district, there are very few decent restaurants.  Oceana is one of them.  They are big and its not impossible to get a reservation. The fish was perfectly cooked, two pan seared striped bass, the two vegetables were well-done, including the latest favorite greens of people like us.  Looking around our location, we saw older folks like us, young family with pompous father and pre-teen girl who was lectured, african-american Mom and daughter. All of us treated with the utmost respect and responsiveness.  The two Margaritas I had were powerful and my wife's wine by the glass was a nice Sauterne.  The dessert of cookies was just OK and the other desserts did not make me excited.  I mentioned City Limits, in the category of what I would like to have for my last meal, their Valrohna Chocolate pudding, would be the dessert.  So, I think they can do better in the dessert category.

"Great restaurant. Nice ambiance, and exquisite service with impeccable attention to detail.   We started with The Rock seafood towers and calamari and each were awesome. The seafood was incredibly fresh and plentiful - great servings for the price. I tried the General Tsao's Lobster over forbidden rice and it's definitely worth trying.

Dinner menu nothing too exciting but good.  My dining partner is very picky, and when he asked for substitutes, the wait staff 'wasn't sure could accommodate but would ask' , and 'they don't make substitutions'.  For a$40 ala carte piece of fish, this policy is simply obnoxious.

"We went here because we had a substantial discount through a hotel/timeshare arrangement, and there's no doubt that helped, because Oceana is not cheap.  But we loved our meal.  Every bit of fish and shellfish was incredibly fresh and beautifully prepared.  My daughter and I shared an excellent roasted whole dorado, with spinach and chanterelle mushroom stuffing.  The fish was firm, clean-tasting, with wonderful crispy skin, the stuffing delightful.   The chanterelles had the texture of pasta and a woodsy taste.  My husband enjoyed a seared yellowtail, prepared precisely as he requested, just seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  He also had an appetizer of multiple choices, including a mackerel toast.  Our gracious and very quiet Japanese female server made excellent suggestions and answered all questions.

"I chose Oceana, an elegant, modern space, because it was walking distance from theater and was glad I did.  It's on the pricey side, but  worth it if you want perfectly cooked and proportioned fish.  In a meat mood, the two men at our table ordered filet mignon and were also very happy.  My first course of hamachi with yuzu sauce was delicious, the broiled halibut crusty but juicy and accompanied by roasted potatoes and well-seasoned broccoli in a separate ramekin.  Dessert sorbets and ice cream were creamy and delicious, obviously house made. Rolls, by-the-glass wine and coffee - my  tests for any restaurant - all received an A+.  We dined early following a matinee, so the restaurant was quiet and there was no lack of attention from the friendly staff.","January 17, 2015",5,5,5,5,"I chose Oceana, an elegant, modern space, because it was walking distance from theater and was glad I did.

"My husband and I went to Oceana before the theater. We are from Buffalo, NY and although we like to consider ourselves to be fairly adventurous when we dine out we do not have as much experience with fish as we would like.    The two appetizers we had were small delightful bites - perfect for sharing and the stars of our meal.  We had the crab cakes and scallops tagliatelle.  Each bite was delicious and full of numerous tastes which were married very well with the other flavors.  For our entrees I had the lobster General Tsao's.  The lobster was cooked perfectly although it was overshadowed by the best General's Tsao sauce, I have ever had even if it was a tiny bit cloying.  I will be researching the forbidden rice because I want to try it again.    My husband had the Seafood Schlachtplatte and it was disappointing.  The weisswurst was VERY fishy (maybe it is supposed to be) but the bratwurst was delicious.    The desserts sounded awesome but we decided to table dessert until after dinner.   The decor was lovely and the service was impeccable.

"My girlfriend and I had pre-theatre dinner at Oceana this weekend. The food was fantastic (though it did take slightly longer than the prescribed 2 hours) and the wine pairings were excellent. We both ended up with an excellent swordfish.   I would recommend trying to get a table in the back room, away from the bar, if you're out on a date. It is substantially more quiet and personal. The service was polite and prompt, as you would expect from a restaurant like this.

Started out a little put off because hostess tried to seat us at a table right next to the bustling kitchen entrance but we asked to be moved to another table and they did. Pricey menu....it would be easy to spend a fortune here if you weren't trying not to.  Food was very good but not phenomenal.  We stayed away from the seafood towers and white truffles that our waiter was pushing. Fried calamari app may have been the best I have ever had.  Dover sole was very good but not extraordinary for the $60 price tag.

"The food was wonderful.  My ahi tuna was medium rare as requested, a perfect presentation.  The crab cake appetizer was perfect and had no filler.  My wife had monkfish with a fried calamari appetizer.  Both were excellent (I had to help her so I know).  One of the dessert options was a chocolate soufflÃ© with cinnamon ice cream.  It really was wonderful and was ready within 15 minutes or so.  The wine and beer choices were good.  The staff was very attentive yet unobtrusive.   I am sure that Oceana will be our first choice for some time to come.  The restaurant is elegant and  casual at the same time.

"Had a phenomenal time.  My kids and I were welcomed warmly, despite the fact the restaurant is probably less ""kid friendly"" and more of a great power lunch business spot.  Waiter was attentive, patient, and helpful.  The food was absolutely delicious!  The fish and chips were not your ordinary soggy cod or over fried deal.  The fish was huge, tasty, and meaty and my daughter thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  We absolutely loved the seafood tower.  Everything so fresh, it smelled like the sea.  Loved the tartars and the shrimp was gigantic!  My son had the light lunch three course and loved his salmon sashimi, mackerel, and parfait.  We will definitely be back next time with my husband!","November 7, 2014",5,5,5,5,"Had a phenomenal time.

"A birthday celebration selection that proved to be a winning choice.

Food was good although monkfish a bit dry, crab cakes were not special.  Surprised vegetable dishes  very good and innovative.

"This is a fine albeit pricey shellfish and fish house in the heart of NYC theater district. Locals and recognizables abound but when I'm in the City this is a must.

It is pretty and has anything from a cold half lobster to a dinner of seafood sausage and sauerkraut.  I will definitely go back.,"September 23, 2014",4,4,4,5,We went before the theater.

"Went on 9/23/14.  Service slow and unresponsive.  Monkfish very tough and rubbery.  Sommalier snooty and not as helpful on the wine as the waiter.  Nowhere as good in any category as the last two times we went over the past year.  Not a good experience.  Interestingly, the tables are big, which is nice, but actually makes it harder to hear in the noisy atmosphere than if closer together.","September 22, 2014",3,2,2,4,"Went on 9/23/14.

Two reasons: the two classic salads had a lot of lettuce.  In particular the lobster salad had shredded and minimal lobster.  The fruit soup was excellent as was the desert.  The most irritating and unexpected problem was the incredible loud noise coming from the kitchen where the orders were yelled to others.  Sitting at another open kitchen a week later found yelling not necessary to process orders.,"September 17, 2014",3,3,5,3,Two reasons: the two classic salads had a lot of lettuce.

Great for a pre-theater show. They work hard to get you to where you are going on time and with a full belly. This is my second time eating here before a show. We chose the pre fixe meal the first time and ordered off of the regular menu the second. We had no problems either time. I try to budget about two hours before the show is supposed to start and that seems to work. This restaurant is in a great location for this,"September 16, 2014",5,5,4,5,Great for a pre-theater show.

"What a find. Oceana blew us away. My wife and I went before theater and were good and hungry due to no lunch. We didn't really explore the wine menu,just ordering a glass of sparkling rose, which was great. I started with the gnocchetti seafood, which I loved. The pasta was cooked just right and the mix of seafood and crispy vegetables was just right. For entre we split the branzino, which was stuffed with spinach and olives. It was a huge portion of lick-the-plate delicious. One if the best fishes I have ever had.   Our waitress was the perfect mix of helpful but not in your face. When i asked about the branzino she simply said that there is hardly a group where it doesn't get ordered and that it is great.  Too full for dessert!","September 13, 2014",5,5,5,5,"What a find.

"Years ago, Oceana was a luxury seafood restaurant with a world-class chef. No more. Today, the restaurant is upscale, with a modern, hard-edged decor, but it's not luxury, and the dishes are more hit-and-miss than in the good old days. Fortunately, more of the dishes are hits than misses, even if at Oceana's price-point, the odds of a hit should be higher. Still, overall, a recent dinner was good enough that I'd happily return.","September 2, 2014",4,4,4,4,"Years ago, Oceana was a luxury seafood restaurant with a world-class chef. No more.

"I'm certain there are better restaurants in Manhattan, but I will be hard pressed to pass this one over and give others a try. The service was incredible, with waitstaff being friendly, professional, and available. The food was as good as I've had, at a wonderful price point (my party of 5 spent about $350 with drinks and appetizers). I started with the calamari which was buttery and not at all chewy. I then ate a seared Yellow Tuna which melted in my mouth and was full of flavor.   The wine selection was extensive and the beer selection was solid.   To top it off, the restaurant is located nicely for a pre-show meal, slightly away from the craziness of Times Square and the Theatre District, but a short enough walk away.","August 23, 2014",5,5,5,4,"I'm certain there are better restaurants in Manhattan, but I will be hard pressed to pass this one over and give others a try.

Too much time passed between visits by our waiter, the interval between ordering drinks and receiving them was interminable, the meal took forever and was served lukewarm (but blame for that can be shared by the waitstaff and kitchen staff).  Our lunch, only one course and coffee, took almost 90 minutes.  Our waiter was indifferent and unapologetic.  I have had nearly a dozen lunches here, usually for business, and the service has always been fine, even when the place is busy, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  It may have been a one-time glitch, so I'll go back at least one more time.","July 23, 2014",4,5,2,4,"At lunch with two co-workers on a day when the dining room was only half- to three-quarters-full, I was surprised at how slow and inept the service was.

"We enjoy dining at Oceana when we are in the city for a show.  Location, setting, staff, menu variety... are all fabulous!  We usually love our meal, but this time it was just okay, with the exception of the gnocci side dish, which was melt in your mouth heavenly and the crab cakes appetizer, which were really scoops of seasoned crab meat, rolled in a crust and pan fried...  they were fantastic.  The entrees surprisingly were just ok.  My husband had the shrimp and black bean pancake dish..  he said it lacked seasoning and that the shrimp were a little tough.  I had the halibut which I typically love.. The sauce was a curry watermelon and it saved the dish, as the halibut was overcooked and dry, so the sauce was needed to moisten the fish.","July 22, 2014",3,3,4,5,"We enjoy dining at Oceana when we are in the city for a show.

"Ah, Oceana. I miss the days in the old place, when the food was fab, before you got big and cavernous. So corporate, so cold, so expensive, yet the promising menu entices you to give it ONE MORE TRY.  So I did.  I took a relative to Oceana (we both work in the area) for a belated birthday lunch.  In the restaurant's slight defense, he had the prix fixe and pronounced the salad topped with grilled salmon to be nothing exciting, but fine.  I ordered the salmon burger, without the bun, but with all the accompaniments, which turned out to be pedestrian tomato, lettuce and onion.  Laughably, it was so small it was served on a dessert plate so it didn't get lost on a ""grown-up"" plate. It looked sad, dry, and so unappealing.

Finally, I ordered scallops which were perfectly prepared and delivered timely.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgable.

"Our dinner at Oceana last evening was one for the books.  We got to meet Chef Ben, who sent out succulent and special offerings throughout the evening, including after-dinner dessert wines to accompany our sweet treats.  Ryan, the floor manager, was his usual dapper and charming self, and all of our wait service was sublime.  Although I am a frequent diner at Oceana and always have a lovely experience there, this dinner service and experience raised the bar to a new level for elegance and doting (but not hovering) service.

"Great location and outdoor seating.  It appeared to be a power lunch type of place inside.  We were on vacation from LA, and sat outside to enjoy the beautiful weather.   We ordered the salmon burger, which seemed to be a popular item, as well as the Lobster sandwich.  Both were meh.  There was no love in the food.  Definitely felt like it was prepared by a line chef who threw the sandwiches together without a care in the world.  Service was good and friendly.

"We had a delicious dinner at Oceana on a Saturday night in June.  The place was mostly empty; the bar was a ghost town. Not surprising for a place serving a 6 ounce (if that) piece of fish, on a plate with a lemon wedge) for $35.  All sides were extra.  The fish was very good and expertly, if simply, prepared, but did not justify the price.  Sides were also very good. Price plus lack of buzz (atmosphere) will keep me away in the future.","May 31, 2014",2,4,4,4,"We had a delicious dinner at Oceana on a Saturday night in June.

It has been a long time since I was at a restaurant that really gave you good service.  Ryan certainly is the perfect person to do that job.

Not like it just had a hard crust, but like it was a bit past its prime and had dried out.  The rest were fine.  The filet was cooked as ordered and it was a good cut of beef, but not as good as what I've had in numerous other high end restaurants.

Arrived after the theater for a 10PM reservation and asked to see the post theater menu. Hostess informed us that they no longer provide one.  This restaurant had been chosen because their website states they offer pre & post theater diners a special menu.  Bread arrived hot, but overcooked and dried out.  The filet had been slightly overcooked and came with no sides. Brussel sprout side dish had more chorizo than vegetables and was mediocre.  Artic Char was good, but not the best seafood. One piece was very fishy. Overall, this restaurant does not live up to the reviews we have seen posted.

"Had pre theater dinner here midweek with 2 couples. One diner has a severe allergy to garlic. The wait staff was incredibly attentive to both our time constraint and the garlic issue. Service was smooth and efficient with a plethora of people unobtrusively assisting. The ala carte and pre theater menus were both tempting as was re wine list by the glass.  Fried calamari and the salads were wonderful. Entrees were three fish dishes, all outstanding, and grilled calamari. The latter was a bit too spicy for the delicate flavor of the squid. Sides of creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts were fantastic. The very loud bar scene dictates you should ask for a table far from the noise. Still noisy but tolerable. Go and enjoy.","April 23, 2014",4,4,5,4,"Had pre theater dinner here midweek with 2 couples. One diner has a severe allergy to garlic.

"I go often for business lunches. This time I tool the grilled dorade, it was very well presented but without the sauce not really fleshy nor tasty. I finally put all the sauce to give a bit of taste. The foie gras as appetizer was good but missing some toasts/bread to eat with... A client of mine ordered the Mahi Mahi and was surprised by the size (small) for the price (high). I was sad this time, but will probably try again to be sure because it used to be better...","April 23, 2014",3,2,3,3,"I go often for business lunches.

"The ambience is a 5 star to me, spacious, elegant, good distance & space between tables, you don't feel crowded even the restaurant is fully seated, and you will have some kind of privacy. Service is great too, satisfied.  Food was ok, a bit disappointed about the crab cakes, for $19 I expected something like traditional jumbo lumps style, but it was 2-pieces of deep-fried crab cakes. Not bad but I didn't feel that worth $19. Of course there are still many interesting dishes on the menu, will go back there sometime and try something else.","April 16, 2014",5,4,5,5,"The ambience is a 5 star to me, spacious, elegant, good distance & space between tables, you don't feel crowded even the restaurant is fully seated, and you will have some kind of privacy.

"A group of us from work decided to enjoy an early pre-theater dinner at Oceana and were not disappointed in the least. Upon first entering the restaurant, the vibrant bar scene raised concern about volume and ability to talk but we were led to a table in the second half of the restaurant which was much calmer overall and ideal for conversation. We informed the waitress of our 7pm theatre engagement and they made sure we were served in time for that, without ever making us feel rushed. The wine and cocktail menu consisted of about 10 pages, and the menu offered an attractive four course pre-theater menu which included raw oysters with passion fruit sauce, fresh fish of the day (mahi mahi), and for dessert a delectable milk chocolate mousse.","April 16, 2014",4,4,5,4,"A group of us from work decided to enjoy an early pre-theater dinner at Oceana and were not disappointed in the least.

"Our second time at OCEANA. This restaurant which started small on East 54th ST years ago certainly has become a behemoth of a seafood oasis here in New York. I love the service staff as they really understand that the customer is why they are and their attentive service shows this. Example; our adult children are Vegans and the kitchen prepared a special non-dairy entree for them, now that's service. T. Then I was notified by our host that the party has increased from three to five and the restaurant hostess didn't blink an eye when I requested a larger table.

"Oceana is a classically beautiful restaurant and the service was impeccable. However, although we enjoyed our dinner, it was nothing special. The whole grilled fish and the arctic char was good but not special. The scallop appetizer left us wanting and don't recommend it.

"My husband and I love seafood towers and for special occasions we typically order the ""big one"" and split it. While the oysters, clams, mussels and shrimp were tasty and fresh there just isn't that much on the tower to charge $120. We don' t like Welks so they agreed to sub them out for mussels, I think, because there were far too many mussels (huge, cold, chewy, (cheap) mussels). There were 6 oysters, 3 clams, 6 shrimps and 4 dishes of random crevice and the meat of a small lobster (this is supposed to serve 6?). Plenty of food for 2 people, totally, but not worth the $120. Anyway skip the plateau here and check out the one at BLT Fish - $15 cheaper with a crazy amount of seafood. You will roll out of there barking like a seal.","February 21, 2014",3,3,3,3,"My husband and I love seafood towers and for special occasions we typically order the ""big one"" and split it.

"For the price, this was an excellent meal. I had the sashimi and mahi-mahi; my wife had the lobster which was a $7. supplement but well worth it. The lobster was shelled but in the shell for presentation-it was broiled, but moist and fresh. The Mahi was fresh and tasty. When we first arrived we were early. They sat us at a 2-top that was small. I requested a different, larger table. Instead of the usual snotty reply from the desk, we were pleasantly surprised that they let us choose which table we would like. The female waiter was friendly and did not rush us. The sommelier was great but not pushy and recommended a nice Russian River selection just shy of $100.00.

Their version of creamed spinach is best I ever ate- including my own not too shabby version.  You will also not leave hungry. Not at all. And that includes people with large appetites, too. There must have been two pounds of fresh spinach in the portion I received. Could NOT eat it all and, believe me, I tried. Service is practically invisible. Attentive but quiet and professional.

"We enjoyed a pleasant dinner in this attractive, upscale restaurant close to the theatre district. Service was very professional, but not stuffy. Tables are close, but, ironically, the energetic noise level dispells the sense that others are listening to your conversations (and you to theirs). Nevertheless, we did end up chatting briefly, and cordially, with our adjacent diners. The rare tuna was of highest quality, but we preferred the sauce that came with the New Orleans shrimp. The shrimp was also accompanied by a nice black bean cake. Good cappuccino and house-made ice cream.","January 18, 2014",4,4,4,4,"We enjoyed a pleasant dinner in this attractive, upscale restaurant close to the theatre district.

Great fresh oyster selection, fantastic seafood appetizers and entres, and a good wine list made for an enjoyable evening.

"it almost took one hour for the food to show up and I noticed that it did not happen just to our table.

"While a lovely restaurant with top-notch, slightly obsequious service (how lovely!), unfortunately the fish fails to inspire. Appetizers were universally yummy and well-cooked, even the simple field greens salad an ode to the loveliness of lettuce with a hint of vinegar. Side vegetables (that touch of cream in the spinach--yum!), chanterelle risotto with an earthy, dark flavor salted with parmiggiano so wonderful. And then...the fish. Both the wild caught sea bass and the grouper were overcooked and almost dry. The crunchy skin on the sea bass charred and tough, with all the delicate oily goodness broiled away. Too heavy a hand there for what should be the signature highlight of a seafood restaurant.  But, we'll give it another try!","December 16, 2013",4,2,4,3,"While a lovely restaurant with top-notch, slightly obsequious service (how lovely!), unfortunately the fish fails to inspire.

We had ordered ice cream for dessert - 1 scoop of lemon verbena, 1 scoop of green apple and 1 scoop of coconut ginger. The distinct flavour of the green apple and coconut ginger was immediately apparent. Neither I nor my wife could taste any lemon flavour with the third scoop and spoke to our waitress who assured us that the lemon verbena flavour was very subtle.

"First time at Oceana, but we will be back. Dinner was fabulous as the atmosphere was full of live. We were celebrating our anniversary and I noted it as such in the OpenTable reservation. When we arrived, the hostess wished us a Happy Anniversary and said they were setting a special table for us, which was very sweet! Both the food and drinks were wonderful. My husband loved his seared Tuna and the jumbo shrimp were delicious and plentiful. My husband ordered a side of the gnocchi. We were apprehensive, as this is not an Italian restaurant, but they were so light and fluffy, not the lead potato dumplings some places call gnocchi. Can't wait to go back!

"Had dinner on Sunday eve: Half-price wines, but limited fresh fish on the menu. It took ~40mins from seating until we got our first solid food! Not all the waitresses fault. She just had too many tables assigned -- and overall service is poorly managed. We started with a seafood tower: 4 oysters, 3 shrimp, and some poke: $28 (seriously!) The fois gras was quite good, but not as in France. The scallops on the plate for two were beautiful, but the accompanying sauces fought their taste. Simple drawn butter would have been much better. Finally, a miniscule (but good) chocolate mousse for $13. My recommendation: Go with friends on Sunday eve for wine. Share a bottle or two, and then go elsewhere to eat.","December 9, 2013",3,3,2,3,"Had dinner on Sunday eve: Half-price wines, but limited fresh fish on the menu.

The cold tower is a MUST as an appetizer. It has a variety of cold seafood- mussels, clams, shrimp,tuna, snail, oysters, and salmon. I had the General Tsao's Lobster- it was spicy but delish!

"I can't put into words how annoying my dinner was. We were completely ignored after the food was put on the table for at least 30 minute. I had an issue with my dish but just had to settle seeing no one checked on me. What's really annoying is that the most all the tables around me were visited by some manager or whomever asking how everything was. Then the waiter shows up asking if I wanted more wine (my glass was empty when the food was delivered). I said no and just asked for the check. After another 15 minutes of nothing, I went to the front desk and asked for it. They said they were sorry but I had enough and just wanted to leave. This is clearly not the old Oceana.

"We went here before seeing a show. The food and service were both good, and yes it was a little pricey but I think that's standard for the area. My only complaint, and it's not huge, is how loud the kitchen is. We weren't seating close to the kitchen, but it's an open kitchen and we could hear them yelling in there throughout our entire meal. If our table was closer to the kitchen I think I'd be upset, it was slightly distracting where we were sitting but not intolerable.","November 30, 2013",4,4,3,3,"We went here before seeing a show.

"We booked Oceana for a pre-theater meal. The food was fantastic, but we found the service to be severely lacking. We were at our table for 15 minutes before someone finally came over and asked if we needed anything. At this point, we were ready to order our whole meal and desperately wanted a cocktail. Our server seemed harried and bothered by our mere presence, so we quickly ordered and he left us alone after that. While the food was great, it took forever to come out, and we had to ask for our dessert and check while we were still eating our entrees just to ensure we made it to our show on time.

"A large dining room with space utilised to the maximum - tables a little too close to each other allowing conversations from neighbouring tables to be overheard easily. A prix fixe menu for Thanksgiving day at $59 promised much but did not deliver, entrees were tepid when served because plates were barely warmed. Our entrees lacked imagination and worse still they lacked flavour. All in all a very poor dining experience followed by a lengthy wait to retrieve our coats from an overworked cloakroom attendant.","November 28, 2013",1,1,3,2,"A large dining room with space utilised to the maximum - tables a little too close to each other allowing conversations from neighbouring tables to be overheard easily.

"This restaurant was carefully chosen, after much thought, for our (family of four) Thanksgiving dinner. The service was very good, the atmosphere was enjoyable and relaxing, and the meal was almost perfect. The appetizers were amazing ---especially pumpkin pasta with shrimp and Brussels sprouts....!! The desserts were works of art and tasted fabulous. The turkey dinner and the apple crusted grouper were as good as it gets!!! The problem was the Cape Cod Turkey.... The cod was delicious, however, the stuffing was disappointing as was the bed of spinach the fish was on. I loved this restaurant. I am hoping this was just an off moment in the kitchen. I will try it again one day.","November 28, 2013",4,3,3,4,"This restaurant was carefully chosen, after much thought, for our (family of four) Thanksgiving dinner.

"Upon entering, one is greeted by beautiful high-end interior spaces, all gorgeously decorated for the holidays for a festive ambiance. Very promising. Great-looking bar. The service was attentive, but provided by staff whose proficiency with the English language was uniformly poor â not what one would expect in a Michelin-starred restaurant in mid-town Manhattan. And the food was very good (and expensive) but not excellent. The assortment of oysters was exceptional; the waiter's selection of oysters was not.

"I went to Oceana with a friend after seeing a show on Broadway on a Sunday Afternoon. First, the ambiance of the interior is wonderful. The interior is a large cozy space scattered with tables, all with a small oil candle, which added to the warmth of the restaurant. The food was spectacular. I then had the salmon which came with a very delicious beet puree, as well as roasted beets, which I am still dreaming of. The salmon was cooked to perfection, buttery and flavorful, a real excitement for the taste buds. I finished the night with a chocolate mousse which reminded me of a museum painting, only in this case it was edible.","November 10, 2013",5,5,5,5,"I went to Oceana with a friend after seeing a show on Broadway on a Sunday Afternoon.

"I cannot believe this is a one-star Michelin restaurant. I have been to many one-stars, and Michelin has never disappointed in the past.

They even had a sommelier who was very generous with his time and recomended a fantastic white wine (should have taken a picture of the label).The fried calamari was very fresh and very lightly breaded, with a delicious homeade tarter sauce. Sis had the salmon with roasted beets, and i had the taro-wrapped Dorade with coconut curry and both were absolutely fantastic--fresh, fresh and reasonable portion sizes (to leave room for everything else). Side dishes are an extra expense, but the brussels sprouts with chorizo and apricot compote were worth it.

"We had Branzino for two. It was a whole fish stuffed with spinach and mushroom and arugula. Excellent, especially when spiced oil, served on the side, was added to it. The menu has a moderately long list of fish, including blue fish, which is not usually found in good restaurants. The prices are on the high side, but fair, certainly much less than a truly outrageous place one block away. I wish the restaurant would impose a dress code. There were diners in sneakers and T-shirts, not conducive to up-scaled dining.","October 24, 2013",5,5,5,4,"We had Branzino for two. It was a whole fish stuffed with spinach and mushroom and arugula.

The entire evening all we could hear was the chef yelling out instructions to the kitchen staff - and I mean he was extremely loud and boisterous. When we mentioned somthing to the waiter, he just commented how he rules the kitchen with an iron fist and walked away. Incredible! We felt like we were in a diner all night... Then my husband ordered the shrimp for $40 which were awful! Totally over cooked and very chewy. I ordered swordfish and it was just average.

The side dishes were very small in portion and not anything special.

Appetizers we had oysters which were amazing and the crab cakes which quite frankly tasted like frozen fish sticks..yuck. dinner i had the halibut which was ok...a tiny overpriced piece of fish which was rather bland. My boyfriend had the filet which was just ok as well. The potato gnocchi which we got on the side was very good...but again very small portion.

"If you haven't been to Oceana, don't miss it. We were in NYC for a visit. We found Oceana via the Hilton and were blown away by the great food, ambience and outstanding service. They paid attention to every detail of our dinner and made sure we were made welcome. Our chosen dishes were: slow roasted cod and the seared sword fish. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly.  We found ourselves wishing we had an Oceana here in Orange County, California. I thought we had it all. We don't :)","September 7, 2013",5,5,5,5,"If you haven't been to Oceana, don't miss it. We were in NYC for a visit.

The choice of wine was extensive and the menu full of varied choices.

"We very much enjoyed our pre-theater dinner at Oceana. It was a holiday weekend, so the meal was very calm and unhurried, which was a pleasure. They asked us when we arrived if we were going to the theater (we were) and so they made sure to have our service complete in good time, but without rushing.

"Remarkably indifferent food for a restaurant of considerable repute. The marinated sardines were tasty but awash in sauce on top of tired fennel. The grilled octopus tender and succulent atop eggplant mash. Overall the flavors were dull when they could have/should have been bright and fresh. Similar experiences for my dining partners. On the plus side the service was friendly and attentive but not overbearing, the room attractive but noisy making conversation a challenge (noise seems to be ""in"" these days everywhere).

The flavorful bean salad appetizer and charred okra side indicated that the kitchen puts considerable creativity into the preparation of vegetables.

"Oceana was a wonderful restaurant, with interesting and well-prepared food, when it was on E. 54th St. The move to 49th St. several years ago didn't seem to harm it.

"This was our second time at Oceana Restaurant, and I can honestly say that we are delighted with the fresh seafood that is expertly prepared and the staff that is extremely helpful and accommodating. We were a group of four, who each ordered a different appetizer and fish dish and we were all pleased with our choices of fish as well as the optional preparations and inclusions of different seasonings and toppings.

"What a disappointment. We go back with Oceana to 8/1/94, when we first dined with them on 54th St. We loved it, ate there regularly over the years, and followed their move to 49th St. with great interest. We were pleased to see that the new business model was successful. They seemed to have expanded their scope and kept what pleased us old standbys. Then, the July 1 dinner disaster. Both our main courses (crusted dorade and Gen. Tso lobster) were awful. That's the only way to put it. The glop surrounding the lobster pieces was indescribable and unanalyzable.

"Oceana is a beautiful restaurant, but this time the food and the service was so so. we tried the seafood tower and the pre-theater menu with the wine paring option. the seafood tower was great with 4 different kinds of sauces. but the rest of the food was a bit too salty. The worst part was the waiter forgot to bring the wine 2 out of 3 glasses. & even the 1st glass that came out without us asking for it, he did not tell us what kind of wine that was. we had to ask the sommelier who happened to walk by the table.

"There are so many mediocre restaurants in the mid town theater district, it is nice to find one that really excels at their craft. Had an excellent dinner there recently, and thoroughly enjoyed the nice menu, staff and surroundings. I imagine it gets loud when full, as it has considerable size, but food quality would win out for me. Nice creative wine list as well, which, as is the norm in NYC, charges too much, but this one has some decent values on it, and wines that are hard to find elsewhere.

"We have been dining at Oceana on everyone of our trips to New York. The food was as expected from Oceana, but the service was not. We arrived just before our reservation and were kept waiting for nearly 10 minutes not an apology or a reason for the delay. Our waitress was not interested in us or our needs, the delivery of food was haphazard and clumsy to say the least, the removal of plates the same. When it came to the bill the waitress showed interest, circling the 20% tip suggestion as the bill was presented and ringed it several times more when she wiped my credit card. I do wish I had not left a tip but there is the pressure the wait staff at Oceana put on you.

"Experience was extremely dissapointing. Salad and fish(cod) were dramatically over saltee, to the point of being inedible. Salmon was dry and bland. Service was mediocre at best.

"We dined on Saturday evening at 8pm and it was very quiet, we had expected a busy vibrant atmosphere. The staff were very good and the wine waiter was knowledgeable. We found the menu quite limited and the Dover sole we ordered was no longer available. The main reason we visited this restaurant was because we love seafood and jazz music. The website advised that a live jazz band was playing every Saturday night..... Which is why we booked. Disappointingly, there was no live music and when we asked one member of staff advised that it stopped a month ago and when we complained to the receptionist on our way out, she advised it stopped a couple of weeks ago.

"This place is very classy, so elegant. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and as we love seafood, and always love to try new places. We naturally opted for a tower, and extra order of raw clams. Now, I've ordered towers from a lot of different seafood places, and this one was definitely unique. It was enjoyable, and included some delicacies that you don't usually find anywhere or offered in regular seafood towers from places - like cod tongue and raw escargot. Wasn't too keen on those. The raw clams they had was superb, and so were the oysters and mussels. The price of their wine is ridiculously expensive, even by the glass - I think that might be the only complaint I have.","March 23, 2013",4,4,4,5,"This place is very classy, so elegant.

"Oceana is an elegant white table cloth restaurant and its prices reflect it. The service was very professional and polished but friendly, not overbearing. The dining room is large and well spaced with both table and more intimate booth seating. The menu is heavily seafood as you would expect with both a full menu and a price fixe pre-theater menu. Appetizers, main course (mahi & lobster) and desert (sorbets) were all excellent, well timed and perfectly presented. Thursday night pre-theater was bustling and the bar was very busy with some noise spilling over into the dining room but not to the extent of detracting from our meal.

Oceana offers a very good pre-theater menu which is also a good value. The calamari appetizer was the most tender well-prepared and generous first course I have had in a very long time.

We could not get over the delicious desserts - chocolate mousse and three exquisite scoops of sorbet (pear was my favorite). My pineapple margarita was perfect - not too sweet. The coffee was also well-brewed and not too strong. Everything from start to finish exceeded our excpections.

"Dined at this restaurant in the old smaller location years ago on 54th street and was blown away with everything top to bottom. Decided to return recently to the new space on 49th street. It's a lot more commercial and less quaint. Food was excellent. We enjoyed selections from the raw bar, wonderful appizers including Foie Gras and excellent entrees such as Red Snapper and General Tsao's Lobster.  Unfortunately, the waitress that was helping us was quite cold and curt in her approach to serving us our meals and answering our questions about the menu. This left us with quite a bad taste in our mouths and has made us think twice about visiting here again.

"Having eaten at the former location on the East side and also several times at the current location, I found this visit to be less appealing than ever before. Service was attentive but scarce due to the crowds that needed to be served. We were constantly looking for a waiter to move us to the next course. Noise level was horrendous. It was my birthday dinner and my date and I were seated next to the kitchen door and could barely hear ourselves speak. The food was delicious and almost up to standard but the noise and stressful environment reduced the overall effect tremendously.

"Truly a remarkable evening. We arrived twenty minutes prior to our reservations and were greeted by a lovely young woman who was welcoming and courteous. Despite our early arrival we were promptly seated. The waiter was excellent and professional, reviewing the many offerings and informing us of his recommendations. Prior to ordering our meals, the sommelier arrived at our table, offering a suggested wine pairing which would enhance our selection of entrees. My wife enjoyed the tuna which was grilled to perfection. I opted for the seared venison and sea scallops along with the plantain mash.

"We went on a quiet night (weather). We had no prior knowledge of Oceana a selected it based on proximity to Broadway prior to a show. Our expectations were exceeded. We had oysters, the foie gras, broiled lobster and chocolate mousse (not theater menu and split all dishes). All of the food as well as the service was fantastic. The cocktails used fresh ingredients with a nice heavy pour. A nice touch was the Amuse-bouches served prior to the apps (a shot of cauliflower clam chowder) and after dessert (cheesecake pops). The prices were very reasonable considering the high quality of food as well as the locale. We eat at high quality restaurants often and we were very pleasantly surprised by Oceana.

The sommelier left and a random person (perhaps the matre de) began bringing us wine and asking us what we had and what we wanted and ogled my friend and me. poor food and service."

"Oceana's service and food were outstanding. We came specifically for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was decorated for the Holidays beautifully. The layout was designed to allow privacy of conversation for each table, which is uncommon. Even though we were close to the kitchen, the layout was still enjoyable. However, we were able to hear the caller's orders barked to the staff (not sure who actually filled this role). Regardless, we were able to have normal conversation.

"We decided to splurge on the Feast of the Seven Fishes here this year. The good news is that not a lot of fish died to feed people at Oceana. The portions were very, very small. Although good and somewhat interesting, the preparation did not justify the $95 price tag. Waiting for food in a full restaurant is understandable. A very long wait for the check is not. Perhaps this was due to what seemed to be an odd staffing pattern that left nobody responsible for our table so someone had to wander by it to find out if we needed anything. The ""energetic"" kitchen sounds might be exciting for some but we had to move to another table. We like an open kitchen - but not one that shares loud sound but not sight.

"A perfectly fine midtown restaurant with much to recommend it strongly.  The food is prepared as though the chef does not want the recipe to get in the way of the best of basic ingredients. This can be a wonderful approach if the ingredients are really that excellent.  The oysters -- served raw on the half shell -- were that good. But the rest of them were not. The short ribs were not that good. The swordfish was not that good. The lobster was not that good (and surprisingly small). The crab cakes might have had crab in them, but did not taste as though it did.  It's as though the chef does not understand what is going in or coming out of his kitchen.  Was it ok? Sure. Would I recommend it to anyone or ever go back? Nope.","December 22, 2012",3,3,4,4,"A perfectly fine midtown restaurant with much to recommend it strongly.

Wait staff was within eye-shot if you wanted anything. Water glass always full. champagne kept on ice and glass was never empty. great good choices. One complaint would be the booths are uncomfortable where you are sitting way too low, we asked to be moved to a regular table with chairs. The chairs are very nice to look at - but also not comfortable. could not sit back in a chair or you would be looking UP, so you had to sit with your back away from the back of the chair which can be a chore.","December 1, 2012",5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant with gorgeous appointments to detail.

"First off, the setting is gorgeous, and the food is amazing. My only peeve is I ordered a starter salad and it was HUGE. I intentionally didn't finish it so I could still eat my lunch entree. Then after devouring my (fantastic foie gras) entree, I left not feeling as stuffed as I should have, given the prices. Alas, Manhattan -- salad and foie gras and club soda = $50. My husband had a salad and a fish entree, and we both ate all the bread they gave us -- he left hungry, too. We are tall and thin with normal appetites.

"This was an utterly disappointing experience, and in all honesty I'm not sure how Oceana has a michelin star. While the ambiance and service is good, the food just doesn't stand out (or justify the price). With great restaurants in close proximity, I'd recommend diners go elsewhere for a better experience. While perhaps a nice place for a quick business lunch at the bar, Oceana is far short of a ""go to"" dinner spot to share with family or loved ones. The raw bar was good (Blue Marlin tartare is unique and tasty), but the Tsao Lobster, grilled shrimp, and mushroom side were bland and unimpressive.

Try the seafood tower for some amazingly fresh clams. Recommended!","October 3, 2012",4,5,4,5,"Our sencond time at Oceana, though the first for lunch.

Awesome!! We loved it so much we went back two days later for our anniversary. Service was A+. Very accomodating of our last minute addition of 2 at our table. I am in the hospitality industry and this is exactly how to treat the guest. The Naked Cowboy Oysters were delicious. The Cheesecake was by far the best we have ever enjoyed.  Will definitely recommend and be back on our next visit!!  Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!,"October 1, 2012",5,5,5,5,Awesome!!

"I introduced some friends to Oceana recently and we enjoyed cocktails in the lovely indoor bar which is so adult, with classic jazz in the background and subdued lighting. On a Monday night, it was the perfect way to start our dinner and the week. We then smoothly transitioned to our dinner table, a charming settee that helped us feel like we had our own private dining room. The food and service were exquisite, as always, and we cannot wait to return. Molto Bueno!","October 1, 2012",5,5,5,4,"I introduced some friends to Oceana recently and we enjoyed cocktails in the lovely indoor bar which is so adult, with classic jazz in the background and subdued lighting.

"I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a very disappointng evening. Our server barely paid attention to our table, even though the restaurant was hardly full, she took my order incorrectly which meant that I ate my entree while my guests were starting their desert.

Nothing was done by management, other than the manager came by to apologize. He didn't even try to offer anything to make up for their mistake.

Although pricey (but what isn't in NYC?) I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there. The service was great - always someone walking by picking up a dish or delivering something to us.

They didn't rush us to leave the restaurant when we were basically the last people to leave. Thank you for a beautiful night.","August 13, 2012",5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing meal at Oceana.

"Oceana is now one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! We went for our anniversary and it was the perfect place. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful but not intrusive. The sommelier was helpful, knowledgeable & willing to share his knowledge. The menu was so interesting that I can't wait to return to try other items. Even the pre-theater menu was tempting but the a-la-carte menu won out. I had an appetizer that included a small papaya salad and Kama (a very tasty piece of fish, I was told) in a sweet and spicy sauce, and an excellent bluefish entree with sweet and sour eggplant. For dessert I had a ""Black & White"" cookie inspired pastry that was excellent yet not a cookie at all! My wife had an equally delicious experience.","August 11, 2012",5,5,5,4,"Oceana is now one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! We went for our anniversary and it was the perfect place.

"The meal we had at Oceana was good but not spectacular. The food was satisfactory although the soft shell crabs I had were somewhat overcooked. Otherwise the food was good enough. The service on this evening was a bit dilatory and it was hard to know why as there seemed to be plenty of wait staff, perhaps our table was a bit out of the way in what is a large restaurant. The wine list is extensive and not exactly economy priced but there are some good buys if you have an eye for them.I might go back but not perhaps tomorrow I think a restaurant in this location and at these prices needs to be one level higher than this.","August 11, 2012",3,3,3,4,"The meal we had at Oceana was good but not spectacular.

"Went to Oceana for a pre-theater dinner, and was pleased with the very convenient location, the quality of the glassware, the variety of the menu, and the waitstaff. We ordered the seafood tower for two and were somewhat disappointed with the quantity and selection of items. There were only three shrimp on a tower for two, and way too many periwinkles. I can't say the shellfish were bad, but not enough oysters, shrimp, or clams. The noise level was a little too loud, causing us to have to speak loudly to hear each other. The main couse was scallops which were perfectly cooked and accompanied by the sauce of your choice, and were delicious. The cocktails and wine were both very good, and overall experience was enjoyable.","August 9, 2012",3,4,3,3,"Went to Oceana for a pre-theater dinner, and was pleased with the very convenient location, the quality of the glassware, the variety of the menu, and the waitstaff.

"My wife and I had dinner here before attending theater, so maybe my review will be unfair because of the early time and rush to make the opening curtain. This is a large bustling spot that failed on many levels. The service was outstanding as well as helpful and friendly. But the food was not good. Our first course was very good (fresh oysters on the half shell) but it arrived without cocktail sauce or vinaigrette. The real problem was the entree which was ""crispy soft shell crabs"" They arrived and they were not crispy and they were barely warm. My wife had the salmon and it was not hot as well. We ordered french fries and they were very, very salty as well as greasy.

"It was just outstanding ! Half shell oysters were very good as a starter. Crab Gumbo was a true Gumbo ! It is really hard to find a real one these days. We first had a full course dinner at the dining room and then we asked if we could move to the bar corner to enjoy the Jazz. Jazz is performed every Saturday night from nine. They carried our wine glasses to the bar table and we even had a wonderful dessert plate. Every dish was delicious, I can't think of any other word.

"The appetizer, some seared foie gras with a delicate texture, turned out to be the best course. One of the entrees was the BBQ ribs with swordfish. Both were well cooked, with each bite melting in your mouth. The sauce accompanying the ribs was very well executed and had a fantastic finish. On the other hand, the swordfish it was so overly seasoned with pepper that you could barely taste the fish itself while the garnish was rather bland. The other entree we had was the seared tuna loin. The fish was very fresh, but unfortunately it was also seasoned with pepper, which masked the taste. Its garnish was, again, bland and half of the potatoes were undercooked. (How could they get the boiled potatoes wrong?)","June 30, 2012",3,3,3,3,"The appetizer, some seared foie gras with a delicate texture, turned out to be the best course.

"My wife and I had the prix fee 3 course theater dinner for $45 / $74 with wine pairing. The dinner special is available both per and post performance. Oceana has a very modern decor with large glass windows and orange and black accents, a full sized bar and a large dinning area. The tables are all nicely arranged with white table cloths and candles that provide a romantic atmosphere. Since Oceana is all about fresh seafood, we stayed with fish for both the appetizer and entree. My wife had the shashimi and I had the fried calamari for the first course. Both were excellent with the ample plate of calamari cooked to perfection. We both had the fish of the day which was fresh grilled grouper.

"Dining at Oceana is an experience. We had oysters of rare quality and freshness, octopus salad with artichoke, and walleye pike for the main course. The food was outstanding, both delicious and imaginative. And while pricy, it was certainly not over the top. As for the service, it has been a while since I have seen such attentive staff at a busy Manhattan restaurant. The couple next to us complained about having too much pepper on their fish and were promptly served new portions.

Chose Oceana given the reviews and they had a pre-fixe menu. We dined here prior to Broadway Show on Sunday and place was half empty . We were seated and given the menu however no pre-fixe which I had to ask and they apologized. They told us you could add a 2 lb lobster for $15 more. On line they have a 1.5 lb for a $5 surcharge. You can also get a 1.25 for no surcharge. My wife and I both got the lobster. We also chose the oysters as the appetizer and they were good but not great. Dessert was also good but not special. Overall we were disappointed given the reviews. In the note section of the reservation we said it was our wedding anniversary. Nothing was mentioned to us about that.

"Exceptional experience all around. We went for my husband's birthday. Quiet, elegant, romantic, friendly and sophisticated atmosphere. Took a recommendation from open table review. Got the Conch Chowder, which was exquisite with apple and pumpkin. Took the waiter's suggestion of the octopus appetizer and the chef's signature dish. The best we've ever had! My husband ordered the Halibut with pineapple salsa and the wild mushrooms, which was generous enough to share. We savored every last morsel. We had no room for dessert, but knowing it was his birthday, they delivered a little sweet treat with happy birthday written on the plate with a candle. How very sweet of them! We'll be sure to come back, loved it!","January 22, 2012",5,5,5,5,"Exceptional experience all around. We went for my husband's birthday.

"We arrived on a snow covered Saturday night at 8:45 because our Openbook reservation options were 5:45pm or 8:45pm. We choose 8:45. It was a short walk from our Waldorf Astoria location. We luckily decided to stop off at Del Fresco's on 49th for a drink at their lively bar because when we arrived at Oceana their bar was empty. We asked our hostess if she would be kind enough to seat us at a bigger table and she said ""... we usually only seat parties of 5 or more there."" The answer was no! No one came in after the 4 of us. The food was amazing. The server was very good and friendly. The atmosphere was, albeit absent of clientele, charming, warm, romantic and well designed.

"The decor is open and classic- a change from many of the NYC restaurants as there is actually space to breathe or have a conversation that you know the table next to you won't hear. The waitstaff is professional and formal though the clientele weren't all dressed up. The crabcakes should be avoided- not good at all. The stuffed branzino was delciious- especially with the sauces dripped on top (they'll put extra on the table). The brussel sprouts shouldn't be missed either. The banana cake desert is chocolatey banana delciousness and will not leave you feeling stuffed. Because we did not care for our crab cakes, the waiter brought us complimentary glasses of muscato- a perfect end to the meal.","January 21, 2012",4,3,4,4,"The decor is open and classic- a change from many of the NYC restaurants as there is actually space to breathe or have a conversation that you know the table next to you won't hear.

"First, the good: the restaurant is beautiful-tall, spacious room with big windows and beautiful elegant white decor. I began my meal with some of the best raw oysters I've ever had. They tasted quite fresh and succulent and the passionfruit sauce complemented it beautifully. For dessert I had a very good guava sorbet which was a perfect end to the evening.  Having said that...honestly, the entrees were just okay. I had the scallops, which were well-cooked and seemed fresh but overly salted. My husband had the dorade which was not particularly impressive either. Service was fine, no complaints, but nothing special.  All in all, a decent meal in a nice location, but with so many other options, I'll try something else next time.","December 16, 2011",3,3,3,4,"First, the good: the restaurant is beautiful-tall, spacious room with big windows and beautiful elegant white decor.

"My GF and I came for an 815 dinner reservation. We were seated promptly. We started witht he Smoked Tuna Roll Appetizer. It was extremely fresh, but very tiny for the price (nearly $20). For entrees, we ordered the Shrimp Grits and the Scallops a la Plancha. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were delicious, cant find a better scallop. The Shrimp dish was very pricy for what you get (4 large shrimp with grits and some other fill-ins for $36). It was decent plate, but would suggest ordering something else. Stick with the fish. The Brussel Sprout Side dish was awesome, we devoured it in 5 minutes. Overall, definitely a good spot, just need to feel out the menu more to find the best value when dining here.","December 14, 2011",4,4,3,5,"My GF and I came for an 815 dinner reservation.

"Oceana is highly deserving of its Michelin star, for the seafood there is sublimely fresh. It is highly recommended one try a seafood tower as an appetizer, and maybe just have that as the main course. The lobster sandwich was somewhat disappointing, especially after an accidental delivery of the lobster salads (they were stunning and looked delicious). Ultimately, everything is prepared beautifully, tastes lovely, and the service is top-notch - but you will undoubtedly pay a pretty penny here.","September 23, 2011",4,4,5,4,"Oceana is highly deserving of its Michelin star, for the seafood there is sublimely fresh.

"Oceana has a longstanding reputation of high quality, service and ambiance, but in this day in age the price value relationship to food quality just didn't measure up. I rate this overall experience to be fair. Having spent over $200 for 2 people, the portions were small and entrees/side dishes were poorly executed. The $48 baked stuff lobster was over broiled and dry. The $30 grilled fish entree portion was small and over cooked. The condiment accompanying the fish was dry and overcooked.

"It's a pricey place, and enjoys a very good reputation. My friend had a very positive experience there a year ago. However, when we went last Saturday night, the food was overcooked and not exciting. I like when a waiter is sure of his recommendations and checks in just often enough, both of which he did. I went with his recommendations, but can't say much about the food justified the price. Worst of all was the dessert. The recommended Zarkana Cup was awful. Each bite was a negative surprise as to temperature, taste, and texture.","July 9, 2011",3,2,4,4,"It's a pricey place, and enjoys a very good reputation.

"Lovely business lunch. We had the peekytoes crabcakes, wood grilled scallops and lobster sandwich for lunch.

Went for lunch recently. Very solid although I would not say it's outstanding. Had a salad with tuna and artichokes that was very refreshing. The tuna was seared perfectly. My companion had the lobster club sandwich and that was also very good- the lobster was so fresh and the bacon with the sandwich made it quite decadent. We had one glass one (the pinot noir by the glass- which was outstanding) and two coffees. We paid about $100 with tax and tip. It's a little over priced in my opinion.

The Manager as well was unbelievable - Who ever hired the employees there should be awarded and grateful to have such an unbelievable staff. -- Top top it off the food was delicious that I ate ALL my food left nothing on the plate :) -- I would 100% go there again if I were to take clients out or even out with friends it is really a unique atmosphere and really chill out place to go to.
"We had wonderful Easter dinner, the staff was exceptional, the food is delicious. The only issue I had was they were sold out of the pink snapper and we were one of the first and only guests seated for dinner @4:45PM, very poor forecasting on part of the chef.

"The only difference between Oceana and a truly great restaurant is the service. The food is extremely well-prepared and presented, but at a recent Sunday brunch service was almost non-existant.

"This place was simply fantastic. First and foremost the service was exceptional, there were times I actually saw the wait staff running back and forth from the kitchen and bar to the tables.

"Everyone was generally pleased with their experience at Oceana. There were six of us that dined at Oceana prior to attending Jersey Boys. The Pumpkin Soup, gnocchi, dessert, and service were outstanding. The entrees consisted of some type of fish. Several individuals ordered the Red Snapper. I ordered mine steamed while the others got theirs blackened. I must say that this was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had regarding Red Snapper. I did not complete my entree primarily due to the fact that I would have needed a steak knife to complete my dinner because the fish was so tough. I was extremely surprised by this.

"A fish-lover's delight! We started with a wonderful array of Pacific coast oysters (but plenty of East coast specimens to choose from too)and awakened our palates with their ocean bouquet. It is an excellent idea to offer both prepared fish dishes and fish ""au naturel"" with sauces offered on the side."" The chefs have a light hand with heat, they clearly respect and understand the fish they are working with and the result was a true joy!

If you are in a banquette on the outskirts of the main dining room the atmosphere is perfect.

"The waitstaff handled the pre-holiday lunchtime crowds cordially and efficiently. We were seated promptly and served professionally. Both my guest and I ordered a fish dish - the portions were meager and looked even smaller because they were served unadorned on a simple white plate, with no accompaniment, and they didn't fill the plate. My first thought was ""what a small piece of fish for $30."" It was prepared well, but all that white space made me feel like I overpaid.","December 22, 2010",3,3,4,3,"The waitstaff handled the pre-holiday lunchtime crowds cordially and efficiently.

"One of the finest seafood restaurants in NYC. The raw oysters, particularly the West Coast Kumamotos, were memorable. Notable dishes include the bay scallops with tapioca, sprinkled with pistachios; the taro wrapped Pompano, which came with an Indian-influenced cilantro sauce; and a beautifully steamed red snapper. The wine list is extensive and appropriately matches the menu.

"Outstanding food; superior yet low-key service, interesting menu, extensive wine list, easy access. Pricey, but not excessively so. Pleasant Ocean liner theme.

The shellfish was superior, the fish cooked just right, side dishes were varied. Desserts were creative variations on classic themes, sized just right, attractively presented.

The separately ordered side dishes and the sauce accompanying the two main fish courses were beautifully executed.

"Overall, a fantastic dining experience! We went there for lunch during NYC restaurant week (RW), and though many restaurants ""cheapen"" the RW prix fixe menu, it was clear that Oceana offered some of their best. Although the plates appeared to be a bit small at first, the amount of food was really just perfect after the three prix fixe courses and the complimentary bread (warm and delicious) prior to the meal. I left feeling full, but not stuffed. The scallop ceviche with peach chutney was the perfect appetizer - fresh and light, but sweet. The bluefish was just slightly chewy, but delicious with the grilled tomato and a kalamata olive tapanade, the flavors blending together to create the perfect bite.

"First visit to this restaurant and it won't be my last. Enjoyed a pre-theatre 3-course meal on a Saturday evening. Food was fantastic. Because I was ordering from a prix fixe menu, I expected portion size to be smaller. Oceana did just the opposite. Ordered the crispy fried calamari for an appetizer. More than enough to feed 2 people. For my entree, I ordered the steamed lobster ($5 supplement). It was good, however, the broiled lobster had a bit more flavor. As a side dish, the sauteed green and yellow beans. Nothing too exceptional. They were beans. For dessert, I ordered the seasonal sorbets with vanilla shortbread. Must have.

"Chose Oceana because of its proximity to the show we were seeing after dinner, and the menu we saw online. We were extremely happy with the food -- started with a few oysters, shrimp & snapper ceviche, went with halibut & scallops as mains, accompanied by pea risotto & spinach. Oysters & shrimp were pretty standard, although the sauces that came with were excellent. Scallops with passionfruit hollandaise were outrageous, & halibut was outstanding, although the sauce (on the side) I chose did not go well. As far as the sides, the risotto was just ok (undercooked rice, bright pea flavor) & probably should have skipped it, but the spinach blew me away.

"If you need a special dining experience in the Rockefeller Center area, I would recommend Oceana. Our $49 per person, prix fixe dinner was a special experience. The wait staff could not have been more attentive. The food was good, although my wife felt that the filet mignon was overcooked. I had salmon, which came with pureed mashed potatoes, and was well prepared. Each dinner came with a salad or appetizer, a side dish and dessert, and was a good value, given the relative price of dinners in this area. The decor is hard-edged modern, the kind of place that appeals to business diners, and attractive.Overall, we both decided that we would return to Oceana on another occasion.","April 16, 2010",4,3,5,4,"If you need a special dining experience in the Rockefeller Center area, I would recommend Oceana.

"Oceana comes to 49th Street from its original location at 54th and has brought all the quality in service and cuisine with it. And...they added a raw bar. Everyone I spoke to was knowledgeable and friendly and their advice was reliable. I highly recommend the Spicy Tuna rolls as a pre-appetizer, the home-made gnocchi with king crab meat and morels, the shad roe sauteed in a mustard-bacon vinaigrette sauce, and the cheese platter. Everything was excellent and the Malaga wine from Spain complimented all dishes very well. Oceana was and is a class act and the patrons all reflect this.

"As seafood lovers, we were hopeful that this theater-district restaurant would be a place to return to as we round out our theater season. While the food was fresh, the seasoning was underwhelming and didn't bring out the flavor of the food.

Asked for server to come over so we could order. Ordered apps, organic green salad ($12) and four shrimp from raw bar($16). The shrimp served on a bed of crushed ice. Every time you cut into a shrimp the ice falls all over the table. Never saw the waiter again. Someone else brought the mains. Tamarind glazed mahi mahi. Tamarind thickly layering the perfectly cooked fish causing me to push it off to the side. Striped bass with perfectly crusted skin. Not one garnish on plate. Manager had more personality than anyone else in the place. Saved the evening. Won't go back. $200 2 people.","March 8, 2010",2,3,1,4,"Arrived 7 PM. No one at hostess station.

"I hadn't been to Oceana in many years so I remember a much smaller restaurant in their old location. However now, it is a huge midtown restaurant. The food was delicious and fresh from the sea and the service was great. However, it would not be a go to restaurant for me on a Saturday nite.

I usually check that the lunch menu is available but since I used open table to make the reservation, I did not check.

"Oceana is the ideal name for this restaurant as everything we had tasted like it was plucked straight from the seas or lakes. Try the ""simply prepared"" fish -- no fuss -- just fresh -- and pair it with one or more of Oceana's sauces, like the blood orange hollandaise, to add some variety. Save room for the many sweet treats on the dessert menu. But, here the seafood is the star. Each dish was taste-filled, and happily not overly-sauced or -seasoned.

"Oceana had a great first impression. The dining room was beautiful and the service was great. The menu looked wonderful- it is a mostly seafood restaurant as the name would imply. Our group ordered the fired calamari for our appetizers and it was delicious (but my mom thought they were over done). For our entrees; my mom's was too salty (they took it off the bill once they found out she wasn't satisfied), mine was a bit burned but not too bad. The best tasting thing was the Pear Tree cocktail. Yum. I would go again to see if the sub-par food was a fluke because I suspect it was.","January 16, 2010",4,3,5,5,"Oceana had a great first impression.

Our waiter was behaving erratically and I felt very uncomfortable around him. I felt as if we had walked into a cave; the staff looked at us as if we were intruders rather than guests.

"I had heard great buzz about this restaurant & was excited to dine here; the space is fabulous - the banquettes are comfortable and not too close to other diners. However, the menu was boring, with plenty of choices but none too exciting that would jump out...very plain. The food presentation was also not great & the portions are small, even the sides. We were rushed through our meal by close to 7 different waiters. I don't mind paying $125 per person for dinner if the meal is note worthy, but my friend and I both agreed that we would not return - there are just too many nearby restaurants that have better food with much better service. Cocktails were $15 each and if you order one w/soda, you are charged $5 extra for the soda!","December 4, 2009",2,2,2,5,"I had heard great buzz about this restaurant & was excited to dine here; the space is fabulous - the banquettes are comfortable and not too close to other diners.

"We were surprised by the service at Oceana. It took a while before our order was taken as our waiter was training someone else.

"The food was very good. They took longer than usual to bring us a menu. We saw a couple that came in after us get menu's before we did. Also, they kept hounding us to buy alcohol (my wife and I are both on antibiotics and can't drink).

"Great Service in a grand space. Unfortunately, my wife and I both had sub par main courses. Her tuna, salmon and yellow tail hamachi was extremely bland. My seafood fish broth was tough, chewy and dank. The floor captain did offer to make me happy by replacing my dish with another after I had already picked through my meal, but by that time I was no longer interested in eating another main course. Dessert did make up for the lackluster main courses.  I would be willing to revisit Oceana for another try.","September 25, 2009",3,3,5,4,"Great Service in a grand space.

"While the food at the ""new"" Oceana is still good, and the ambiance has a lovely moderne/deco feel, the service is abysmal--particularly considering the price point. Servers were either no place to be found, or hovering and taking plates or glasses before we had finished. We had plates actually removed from the table twice, while someone was holding a fork over them!!! We had to call the servers back both times. Ridiculous. Another problem:the wine steward is more salesman than steward. We had picked out a bottle of wine in a particular price range--the steward should, of course, recommend other bottles in a similar range. Instead, bottles costing hundreds of dollars more were pressed on us. Not helpful.","September 22, 2009",4,4,2,5,"While the food at the ""new"" Oceana is still good, and the ambiance has a lovely moderne/deco feel, the service is abysmal--particularly considering the price point.

"The new Oceana is massively overpriced. I used to frequent the former location often for business lunches. I just had lunch at the new site yesterday, however, and was totally shocked to find that a simple piece of grilled salmon now cost $36 at LUNCH.

I will not be coming back unless prices are brought down.

Just a few off notes on the design - the wall banquettes are uncomfortably cramped; the table is too large for the banquette and the two end seats were cramped by the end side panels of the banquette. A pregnant woman would not fit. We were graciously moved to a much more comfortable table. The menu and food was very good, I would expect nothing less of Oceana.

"My husband and I chose the Restaurant week lunch menu. We found it excellent and creative. It was our first dining experience at Oceana and are planning a return visit. This restaurant certainly understands the meaning of ""Restaurant Week"", which I feel is to make an impression so that the diner will return. The restaurant, although lovely, is quite small, so that tables are close together, so much so that one can't help but hear your neighbor's conversation. The restaurant will be moving to a new space, and possibily will offer a bit more privacy between tables.

"First couse soup was ok, but portion was very small, one ladle full. We waited 45 minutes for a main course that then had to be returned. The small piece of fish was way to salty for any taste. Then, had to wait again for a dish that was served in separate sections: broken piece of fish fillet, miniscule vegetable portion and sauce in a separate container. All was pretty tasteless. Desert was a frozen mousse that was way too icey to be called mousse. Upstairs dining room three flights to the nearest restroom.

"I was anxious to eat at Oceana for a very long time. However, I have never had such small portions. It seemed to me they took one piece of fish and broke it into 3 portions for me and my friends. But the worst thing of all - they charged $7.00 for a cup of coffee. I have never paid that amount anywhere. The menu referred to the coffee as fresh pressed - it came in a coffee pot and could have been poured from a big urn in the kitchen.

"We took advantage of the ""Appetite Stimulus"" $35.00 dinner offer to try out this restuarant. This price was less than half the cost of the standard 3-course dinner at Oceana. The restaurant did an excellent job of creating an interesting low-cost meal, without stinting on quality, presentation or quantity. The meal was satisfying with a variety of flavors offered. There were two of us, and two choices for each course, so we ordered and tasted everything on the menu. Also, Oceana offers wine by the glass in two serving sizes, 6 oz. and 3 oz.

They did accomodate our 8 year old son and they were very inclusive while bringing out the courses - they did a simple pasta and brought some other things out for our son at a cost of $45.00 (I believe) 1/2 of the fixed menu price!,"April 22, 2004",5,5,5,3,The food at this restaurant is OVER THE TOP AMAZING!!!!
